## 🎯 The Correct Flow (Now Tested)

```
You: "unlock my screen"
      ↓
JARVIS:
  1. Captures your voice (✅ tested)
  2. Extracts biometric embedding - ECAPA-TDNN 192D (✅ tested)
  3. Compares to database - 59 samples of Derek (✅ tested)
  4. Recognizes: "This is Derek!" - 95% confidence (✅ tested)
  5. Unlocks screen (✅ tested)
  6. Says: "Of course, Derek. Unlocking your screen now." (✅ tested)
```

**No wake word needed - just voice biometrics!**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"All tests failing"**
→ Check Python version (3.10+), dependencies installed

**"Database tests failing"**
→ Verify Cloud SQL connection, 59 samples exist

**"Speaker not recognized in real-time"**
→ Check confidence threshold, voice sample quality

**"Performance tests timeout"**
→ May need to adjust thresholds for slower runners

### Getting Help

1. Check `VOICE_BIOMETRIC_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (full guide)
2. Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions
3. Download and inspect JSON test artifacts
4. Look at failed test detailed error messages
