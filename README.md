## üß† ML Voice Training System

JARVIS includes an advanced ML-based voice training system that learns and adapts to your voice patterns over time.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Learning**: Every voice interaction trains the system
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learns your common commands and speech patterns
3. **Error Correction**: Remembers and corrects recurring recognition mistakes
4. **Personalized Profiles**: Builds a unique voice profile for each user

### ML Voice Commands

```
"Show my voice stats"
‚Üí "You've used voice commands 150 times with 92% accuracy recently."

"Personalized tips"
‚Üí "Based on your patterns, try speaking slightly slower for better accuracy. 
   I notice 'play music' is often recognized as 'play musik' - I'll correct this automatically."

"Export my voice model"
‚Üí "Your voice model has been exported successfully. Check the models directory."

"Improve accuracy"
‚Üí "Let's improve my accuracy. I'll guide you through a quick calibration..."
```

### Voice Statistics Dashboard

The ML system tracks:
- **Total Interactions**: Number of voice commands used
- **Accuracy Trends**: How your accuracy improves over time
- **Common Commands**: Your most frequently used commands
- **Mistake Patterns**: Common recognition errors (automatically corrected)
- **Voice Characteristics**: Audio features like pitch, speech rate, and clarity

### Adaptive Features

1. **Predictive Correction**: 
   - If you often say "play sum musik" ‚Üí JARVIS learns to interpret as "play some music"
   
2. **Context Learning**:
   - Learns your command patterns (e.g., "play music" usually followed by "volume up")
   
3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identifies unusual patterns (background noise, different microphone, etc.)
   
4. **Command Clustering**:
   - Groups similar commands together for better understanding

### Privacy & Data

- All voice data is processed locally
- Voice profiles are stored in `backend/models/voice_ml/`
- Export/import your voice model anytime
- No voice data is sent to external services (except transcribed text to Claude)
