- Screen Recording permission
- Anthropic API key

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JARVIS-AI-Agent.git
cd JARVIS-AI-Agent

# 2. Set up API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here" > backend/.env

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# 4. Grant permissions (macOS)
# System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Screen Recording
# Check the box next to Terminal/IDE

# 5. Start JARVIS
python start_system.py
```

### Enable 100% Autonomy

```javascript
// Simply say:
"JARVIS, activate full autonomy"

// Or in the UI:
Click "Enable 100% Iron Man Mode"

// JARVIS will:
// - Start predictive intelligence
// - Enable voice announcements
// - Monitor your workspace
// - Control system resources
// - Adapt to your personality
```

### Example Voice Commands

```javascript
// Natural conversation examples:
"Good morning JARVIS"
"I need to focus for 2 hours"
"Prepare for my meeting"
"I'm feeling stressed"
"Optimize my system"
"Enable privacy mode"
"What's my schedule?"
"Thanks JARVIS"
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Complete AI Pipeline Flow

```
Vision + Audio Input → AI Brain (Claude) → Contextual Analysis → Predictive Engine → Decision Making
        ↓                    ↓                    ↓                   ↓                  ↓
   Screen/Voice      Pattern Learning    Emotional State    Future Needs    Autonomous Actions
                                                                              ↓
                                        Voice Announcements ← Execution → System Control
```

### Example: Full Autonomy in Action

```python
# Morning Routine - JARVIS Acts Proactively
1. JARVIS detects: User login at 9 AM (learned pattern)
2. Predictive Analysis: 
   - User typically starts with email
   - Has standup meeting at 9:30 AM
   - Prefers coffee break at 10:30 AM
3. Autonomous Actions:
   - Voice: "Good morning sir. Your workspace is ready."
   - Opens email client in focused position
   - Prepares meeting notes from yesterday
   - Sets display brightness to preferred morning level
   - Schedules coffee break reminder
   - Mutes non-urgent notifications until standup
4. Continuous Monitoring:
   - Watches stress levels
   - Adjusts environment as needed
   - Provides proactive suggestions
```

- **User Approval** - Sensitive actions need confirmation
- **No Cloud Storage** - All data stays local
- **Encrypted API** - Secure Claude API communication
- **Hardware Control** - You control what JARVIS can access
- **Protected Apps** - System apps cannot be modified
- **Learning Privacy** - Patterns stored locally only

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Can't see screen" | Grant Screen Recording permission and restart Terminal/IDE |
| "OCR not working" | Install tesseract: `brew install tesseract` |
| "High latency" | Check CPU usage and reduce capture frequency |
| "Actions not executing" | Verify action queue is running in pipeline status |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check vision system
curl http://localhost:8000/vision/status

# View pipeline metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/vision/monitoring/report

# Test screen capture
