### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Powered-Chatbot.git
cd AI-Powered-Chatbot

# Create environment file
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Voice dependencies (required for JARVIS voice)
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pygame pyaudio

# ML training dependencies (optional but recommended for adaptive learning)
pip install -r backend/voice/requirements_ml.txt

# macOS users: If pyttsx3 fails, we'll use native 'say' command automatically

# Frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Launch JARVIS

```bash
# Quick start - uses async for 3x faster startup
python start_jarvis.py

# Or run directly
python start_system.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Start services in parallel (async version)
- ✅ Start the FastAPI backend server
- ✅ Launch the React frontend
- ✅ Initialize JARVIS voice system
- ✅ Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## 🎙️ Voice Control Guide

### Wake Word Activation

1. **Enable Wake Word Mode**
   - Click "Enable Wake Word" button in the UI
   - Arc Reactor turns purple (continuous listening)
   
2. **Activate JARVIS**
   - Say "Hey JARVIS" or just "JARVIS"
   - Arc Reactor turns gold (awaiting command)
   - JARVIS responds: "Yes, sir?"

3. **Give Your Command**
   - Speak your command within 5 seconds
   - Examples: "What's the weather?", "Calculate 2 + 2", "Tell me a joke"

### Visual States

| Arc Reactor Color | State | Description |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| 🔵 Blue | Idle | Default state, not listening |
| 🟣 Purple | Continuous Listening | Listening for wake word |
| 🟡 Gold | Awaiting Command | Wake word detected, waiting for command |
| 🔴 Orange | Active Listening | Recording your voice |
| 🟢 Green | Processing | Thinking about your request |

### Voice Commands Examples

```
"Hey JARVIS"
→ "Yes, sir? How may I assist you?"

"What's 2 plus 2 times 2?"
→ "Following the order of operations, sir: 2 × 2 = 4, then 2 + 4 = 6."

"What time is it?"
→ "It's currently 3:47 PM, sir. Might I suggest a brief respite? You've been working for 2 hours."

"Tell me about quantum computing"
→ "Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical phenomena, sir..."

"What's the weather like?"
→ "Currently in Toronto, we have partly cloudy with a temperature of 21 degrees Celsius. Wind speed is 15 kilometers per hour. Beautiful weather for any outdoor activities you might have planned."

"What's the weather in New York?"
→ "Currently in New York, we have clear skies with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. Quite warm today, sir. Perhaps consider lighter attire."

"Goodbye JARVIS"
→ "Shutting down. Goodbye, sir."
```

## 🌤️ Weather Features

JARVIS includes real-time weather data integration with OpenWeatherMap API.

### Weather Service Status: ✅ ENABLED

The weather service is now fully configured and ready to use! JARVIS can provide real-time weather data for your location or any city worldwide.

### Features:
- **Automatic location detection** based on IP geolocation
- **Real-time weather data** for any major city
- **Contextual weather advice** (e.g., "Take an umbrella" when raining)
- **Current conditions**: Temperature, feels-like, wind speed, humidity
- **JARVIS-style suggestions** based on weather conditions

### Usage Examples:
```
"What's the weather like?"
→ Gets weather for your current location

"What's the weather in Paris?"
→ Gets weather for specific city

"Is it going to rain?"
→ Checks current conditions for rain

"What's the temperature outside?"
→ Reports current temperature with personalized advice
```

### Technical Details:
- API Key is configured in `.env`
- Fallback to Claude's knowledge if API is unavailable
- Location detection via IP geolocation
- Temperature in Celsius with wind speed in km/h

## 🧠 ML Voice Training System

JARVIS includes an advanced ML-based voice training system that learns and adapts to your voice patterns over time.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Learning**: Every voice interaction trains the system
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learns your common commands and speech patterns
3. **Error Correction**: Remembers and corrects recurring recognition mistakes
4. **Personalized Profiles**: Builds a unique voice profile for each user

### ML Voice Commands

```
"Show my voice stats"
→ "You've used voice commands 150 times with 92% accuracy recently."

"Personalized tips"
→ "Based on your patterns, try speaking slightly slower for better accuracy. 
   I notice 'play music' is often recognized as 'play musik' - I'll correct this automatically."

"Export my voice model"
→ "Your voice model has been exported successfully. Check the models directory."

"Improve accuracy"
→ "Let's improve my accuracy. I'll guide you through a quick calibration..."
```

### Voice Statistics Dashboard

The ML system tracks:
- **Total Interactions**: Number of voice commands used
- **Accuracy Trends**: How your accuracy improves over time
- **Common Commands**: Your most frequently used commands
- **Mistake Patterns**: Common recognition errors (automatically corrected)
- **Voice Characteristics**: Audio features like pitch, speech rate, and clarity

### Adaptive Features

1. **Predictive Correction**: 
   - If you often say "play sum musik" → JARVIS learns to interpret as "play some music"
   
2. **Context Learning**:
   - Learns your command patterns (e.g., "play music" usually followed by "volume up")
   
3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identifies unusual patterns (background noise, different microphone, etc.)
   
4. **Command Clustering**:
   - Groups similar commands together for better understanding

### Privacy & Data

- All voice data is processed locally
- Voice profiles are stored in `backend/models/voice_ml/`
- Export/import your voice model anytime
- No voice data is sent to external services (except transcribed text to Claude)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No module named 'speech_recognition'"** | Run: `pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio` |
| **"WebSocket connection refused"** | Ensure backend is running: `python backend/main.py` |
| **"Microphone not found"** | Grant microphone permissions in System Preferences |
| **"pyttsx3 import error on macOS"** | System will auto-use macOS 'say' command |
| **Voice not responding** | 1. Check microphone permissions<br>2. Test with `python test_jarvis_voice.py`<br>3. Ensure quiet environment for calibration |
| **Memory warnings on M1** | Normal - system auto-optimizes. Warnings at 0.8% are false positives |
| **ML training not available** | Install ML dependencies: `pip install -r backend/voice/requirements_ml.txt` |
| **Voice stats empty** | ML system needs 20+ interactions to start generating insights |
| **Low accuracy reported** | 1. Run "improve accuracy" command<br>2. Check for background noise<br>3. Ensure consistent microphone placement |

### Testing Components

```bash
# Test voice system
python test_jarvis_voice.py

# Test Claude integration
python test_claude_math.py

# Test JARVIS personality
python -m backend.voice.jarvis_voice

# Test ML training system
python -m backend.voice.voice_ml_trainer

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Logs & Debugging

```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f backend/logs/jarvis.log

# Frontend logs
# Open browser console (F12)

# Memory status
curl http://localhost:8000/memory/status
```

## 💡 Advanced Features

### Custom Wake Words

```python
# In backend/voice/jarvis_voice.py
self.wake_words = ['jarvis', 'hey jarvis', 'computer', 'assistant']
```

### Voice Synthesis Options

**macOS** (Automatic):
- Uses native 'say' command
- British voice: Daniel
- Customizable rate and pitch

**Other Platforms**:
- pyttsx3 with system voices
- espeak-ng support
- Azure/Google TTS (optional)

### Memory Optimization

The system includes intelligent memory management:
- Component prioritization (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
- Automatic unloading of unused components
- M1 unified memory optimization
- Real-time memory monitoring

## 🎨 UI Customization

### Arc Reactor Colors

Edit `frontend/src/components/JarvisVoice.css`:

```css
/* Customize Arc Reactor states */
.arc-reactor.continuous .core {
  background: radial-gradient(circle, #9400d3 0%, #4b0082 50%, #310062 100%);
}

.arc-reactor.waiting .core {
  background: radial-gradient(circle, #ffd700 0%, #ffaa00 50%, #ff8800 100%);
}
```

### Adding New Animations

```javascript
// In JarvisVoice.js
const handleCustomAnimation = () => {
  setArcReactorClass('custom-animation');
  // Your animation logic
};
```
