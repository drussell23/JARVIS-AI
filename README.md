## 🧠 ML Voice Training System

JARVIS includes an advanced ML-based voice training system that learns and adapts to your voice patterns over time.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Learning**: Every voice interaction trains the system
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learns your common commands and speech patterns
3. **Error Correction**: Remembers and corrects recurring recognition mistakes
4. **Personalized Profiles**: Builds a unique voice profile for each user

### ML Voice Commands

```
"Show my voice stats"
→ "You've used voice commands 150 times with 92% accuracy recently."

"Personalized tips"
→ "Based on your patterns, try speaking slightly slower for better accuracy. 
   I notice 'play music' is often recognized as 'play musik' - I'll correct this automatically."

"Export my voice model"
→ "Your voice model has been exported successfully. Check the models directory."

"Improve accuracy"
→ "Let's improve my accuracy. I'll guide you through a quick calibration..."
```

### Voice Statistics Dashboard

The ML system tracks:
- **Total Interactions**: Number of voice commands used
- **Accuracy Trends**: How your accuracy improves over time
- **Common Commands**: Your most frequently used commands
- **Mistake Patterns**: Common recognition errors (automatically corrected)
- **Voice Characteristics**: Audio features like pitch, speech rate, and clarity

### Adaptive Features

1. **Predictive Correction**: 
   - If you often say "play sum musik" → JARVIS learns to interpret as "play some music"
   
2. **Context Learning**:
   - Learns your command patterns (e.g., "play music" usually followed by "volume up")
   
3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identifies unusual patterns (background noise, different microphone, etc.)
   
4. **Command Clustering**:
   - Groups similar commands together for better understanding

### Privacy & Data

- All voice data is processed locally
- Voice profiles are stored in `backend/models/voice_ml/`
- Export/import your voice model anytime
- No voice data is sent to external services (except transcribed text to Claude)

## 🔄 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: JARVIS Responds Twice to Wake Word

**Symptom**: When you say "Hey JARVIS", you hear "Yes, sir?" twice

**Solution**: This is likely due to dual audio systems (frontend + backend) both responding:
1. Backend JARVIS speaks first (via macOS 'say' command)
2. Frontend speech synthesis follows

**Fix**: The system is designed to prioritize backend speech. The frontend acts as a fallback. This is normal behavior and ensures you always get a response.

### Issue: Weather Location Not Accurate

**Symptom**: JARVIS gives weather for wrong location

**Solution**: 
1. Ensure OpenWeatherMap API key is set in `.env`
2. Be specific: "weather in Oakland, California" instead of just "Oakland"
3. The system supports ANY location globally - no hardcoded lists

### Issue: Speech Not Working

**Symptom**: Can't hear JARVIS responses

**Solution**:
1. Check system volume is not muted
2. On macOS: System Preferences → Sound → Output volume
3. Test with the "Test Audio" button in the UI
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Ensure microphone permissions are granted

### Issue: Wake Word Not Detected

**Symptom**: Saying "Hey JARVIS" doesn't activate

**Solution**:
1. Click "Start Listening" button first
2. Wait for purple Arc Reactor (listening mode)
3. Speak clearly and wait for the full phrase
4. Try both "Hey JARVIS" and just "JARVIS"
5. Check for background noise interference

## 🎮 Usage Guide

    ↓
Dual Speech Output:
    ├── Backend TTS (primary)
    └── Frontend TTS (fallback)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Audio System**
   - Backend: Native OS speech (better quality)
   - Frontend: Browser speech (universal fallback)
   - Prevents silent failures

2. **WebSocket vs REST**
   - WebSocket: Real-time voice streaming
   - REST: Fallback for reliability
   - Automatic switching based on connection

3. **Async Architecture**
   - 3x faster startup with parallel init
   - Non-blocking API calls
   - Efficient resource usage

4. **Memory Management**
   - Intelligent component loading
   - Priority-based resource allocation
   - M1 Mac optimizations

## 🎯 Performance Optimization

### Speed Improvements

1. **Startup Optimization**
   ```python
   # Parallel service initialization
   await asyncio.gather(
       start_backend(),
       start_frontend(),
       check_weather_cache()
   )
   ```

2. **Response Caching**
   - Weather: 5-minute cache
   - Common queries: In-memory cache
   - Voice models: Pre-loaded

3. **WebSocket Efficiency**
   - Binary protocol for audio
   - Message compression
   - Connection pooling

### Resource Usage

| Component | Idle | Active | Peak |
|-----------|------|--------|------|
| CPU | < 5% | 10-15% | 20% |
| Memory | 300MB | 500MB | 800MB |
| Network | 1KB/s | 50KB/s | 200KB/s |

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Enable Debug Logging

```python
# In .env
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Common Debug Commands

```bash
# Watch backend logs
tail -f backend/logs/jarvis.log

# Monitor WebSocket traffic
# In browser console:
localStorage.debug = 'websocket:*'

# Test microphone
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; r = sr.Recognizer(); print(sr.Microphone.list_microphone_names())"
```

### Browser Console Commands

```javascript
// Test speech synthesis
speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Test'))

// List available voices
speechSynthesis.getVoices().map(v => v.name)

// Check WebSocket state
document.querySelector('iframe').contentWindow.wsRef.current.readyState
```

## 🌐 Deployment

### Production Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Production .env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=...
   ENV=production
   DEBUG=false
   ```

2. **Reverse Proxy (nginx)**
   ```nginx
   location /api {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
   }
   ```

3. **Process Management (PM2)**
   ```bash
   pm2 start backend/main.py --name jarvis-backend
   pm2 start npm --name jarvis-frontend -- start
   ```

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile (backend)
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    env_file: .env
  
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://backend:8000
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need a powerful computer to run JARVIS?**
A: No! JARVIS uses cloud-based Claude AI, so most processing happens remotely. Any modern computer with 4GB RAM is sufficient.

**Q: Can JARVIS work offline?**
A: Limited functionality. Weather and Claude AI require internet, but basic voice recognition works offline.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes. Voice processing is local, only transcribed text goes to Claude. No conversation history is stored permanently.

**Q: Can I use JARVIS commercially?**
A: Check Anthropic's Claude API terms. The codebase itself is MIT licensed.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does JARVIS speak twice sometimes?**
A: This is the dual audio system ensuring you always hear responses. Backend speaks first (better quality), frontend is fallback.

**Q: Can I change JARVIS's voice?**
A: Yes! On macOS, change the voice in `backend/voice/macos_voice.py`. On other systems, modify `pyttsx3` settings.

**Q: How do I add new commands?**
A: Commands are processed by Claude AI, so just describe what you want. For specific integrations, modify `jarvis_voice.py`.

**Q: Can JARVIS control my smart home?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. You can add integrations by extending the command processing in `jarvis_voice.py`.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why can't JARVIS hear me?**
A: Check:
1. Microphone permissions granted
2. "Start Listening" clicked
3. Background noise levels
4. Correct microphone selected in system

**Q: Weather always shows "Toronto"?**
A: Ensure:
1. OpenWeatherMap API key is set
2. You're specific about location
3. `geocoder` package is installed

**Q: JARVIS responds slowly?**
A: Normal Claude API response is 1-2 seconds. Check:
1. Internet connection speed
2. Claude API status
3. Consider using cached responses
