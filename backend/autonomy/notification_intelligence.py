"""
Notification Intelligence System for JARVIS.

This module provides an intelligent notification detection and announcement system
that uses computer vision and AI to understand notifications from any application
without hardcoding specific app behaviors. It learns patterns and adapts to user
preferences over time.

The system integrates with the vision pipeline to detect visual notification
indicators (badges, banners, alerts) and uses OCR and AI to understand their
content and context, then generates natural speech announcements.

Example:
    >>> notif_intel = NotificationIntelligence()
    >>> await notif_intel.start_intelligent_monitoring()
    >>> # System will now detect and announce notifications intelligently
