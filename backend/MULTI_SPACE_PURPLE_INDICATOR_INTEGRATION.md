# Multi-Space Vision System with Purple Indicator Integration

## Overview

The multi-space vision system has been integrated with JARVIS's existing purple indicator monitoring mechanism. When users say "start monitoring my screen", JARVIS will:

1. Show the purple indicator in the menu bar (macOS screen recording confirmation)
2. Enable multi-space vision capabilities
3. Use the active monitoring session for efficient captures across spaces

## Key Integration Points

### 1. MultiSpaceCaptureEngine Enhancement

The `MultiSpaceCaptureEngine` now integrates with the existing `direct_swift_capture.py`:

```python
# New methods added:
async def start_monitoring_session(self) -> bool:
    """Start monitoring session with purple indicator"""
    
def stop_monitoring_session(self):
    """Stop monitoring session and remove purple indicator"""
```

### 2. Monitoring Session Benefits

When monitoring is active (purple indicator visible):
- **No Permission Prompts**: Already has screen recording permission
- **Efficient Captures**: Can capture any space without re-requesting permission
- **Shared Session**: Multi-space queries leverage the existing session
- **Visual Confirmation**: Purple indicator shows JARVIS is monitoring

### 3. Command Flow

#### Start Monitoring
```
User: "Hey JARVIS, start monitoring my screen"
↓
VisionCommandHandler._handle_monitoring_command()
↓
PureVisionIntelligence.start_multi_space_monitoring()
↓
MultiSpaceCaptureEngine.start_monitoring_session()
↓
DirectSwiftCapture.start_capture()
↓
Purple indicator appears
```

#### Multi-Space Query During Monitoring
```
User: "Where is Terminal?"
↓
Multi-space query detected
↓
MultiSpaceCaptureEngine.capture_all_spaces()
↓
Uses active monitoring session (no new permissions needed)
↓
Returns results from all spaces
```

#### Stop Monitoring
```
User: "Hey JARVIS, stop monitoring my screen"
↓
VisionCommandHandler._handle_monitoring_command()
↓
PureVisionIntelligence.stop_multi_space_monitoring()
↓
MultiSpaceCaptureEngine.stop_monitoring_session()
↓
DirectSwiftCapture.stop_capture()
↓
Purple indicator disappears
```

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

1. **vision/multi_space_capture_engine.py**
   - Added `monitoring_active` flag
   - Integrated with `direct_swift_capture`
   - Added `start_monitoring_session()` and `stop_monitoring_session()`
   - Created `_capture_with_swift_monitoring()` for efficient captures

2. **api/pure_vision_intelligence.py**
   - Updated `start_multi_space_monitoring()` to trigger purple indicator
   - Updated `stop_multi_space_monitoring()` to remove purple indicator

3. **api/vision_command_handler.py**
   - Integrated multi-space monitoring calls
   - Ensures purple indicator appears/disappears correctly

### Performance Benefits

1. **Single Permission Request**: User grants permission once when monitoring starts
2. **Efficient Multi-Space Capture**: No need to request permission for each space
3. **Visual Feedback**: User knows when JARVIS is monitoring via purple indicator
4. **Seamless Experience**: Multi-space queries work naturally during monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```
User: "Start monitoring my screen"
JARVIS: "I've started monitoring your screen. I can see Safari open with documentation..."
[Purple indicator appears]
```

### Multi-Space Query While Monitoring
```
User: "Where is Slack?"
JARVIS: "I can see Slack is open on Desktop 2. You have 3 unread messages..."
[Uses active monitoring session - no new permission needed]
```

### Stop Monitoring
```
User: "Stop monitoring"
JARVIS: "I've stopped monitoring your screen."
[Purple indicator disappears]
```

## Error Handling

- If Swift capture is not available, system falls back to standard capture methods
- If monitoring session fails to start, multi-space queries still work but may need permission
- Clear error messages guide users to enable screen recording if needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Direct Buffer Access**: Access Swift capture buffer directly for faster multi-space captures
2. **Continuous Updates**: Stream updates from all spaces during monitoring
3. **Smart Prefetching**: Predictively cache spaces based on user patterns
4. **Enhanced Purple Indicator**: Show space count or activity level in indicator

The integration provides a seamless experience where the existing monitoring infrastructure enhances multi-space capabilities without requiring any user behavior changes.
