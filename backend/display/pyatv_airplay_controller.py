PyATV AirPlay Controller
========================

Protocol-level AirPlay control using pyatv library.
Bypasses UI automation entirely - direct network communication.

Features:
- Auto-discovery of AirPlay devices
- Direct streaming/mirroring via RAOP protocol
- Persistent credential storage
- Fast connection (~0.5-1s)

This module provides a high-level interface for controlling AirPlay devices using the pyatv
library. It handles device discovery, connection management, credential storage, and screen
mirroring operations through a combination of protocol-level communication and system
integration.
