PyATV AirPlay Controller
========================

Protocol-level AirPlay control using pyatv library.
Bypasses UI automation entirely - direct network communication.

Features:
- Auto-discovery of AirPlay devices
- Direct streaming/mirroring via RAOP protocol
- Persistent credential storage
- Fast connection (~0.5-1s)
