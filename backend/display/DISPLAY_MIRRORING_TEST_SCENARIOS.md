## Medium Scenarios

### Scenario 4: Connect to Display with Similar Name

**Objective:** Handle disambiguation when multiple displays have similar names

**User Action:**
```
User: "Living Room"
```

**Challenges:**
- Multiple displays: "Living Room TV", "Living Room Speaker", "Living Room Hub"
- Pattern matching must prioritize AirPlay-capable devices
- User intent: likely wants TV, not speaker

**System Flow:**
1. Voice command received: "Living Room"
2. Pattern matching finds multiple candidates:
   - "Living Room TV" (score: 0.9, type: AirPlay display)
   - "Living Room Speaker" (score: 0.8, type: Audio device)
   - "Living Room Hub" (score: 0.7, type: HomeKit hub)
3. Filter by device type: Prioritize AirPlay displays
4. Select "Living Room TV" (highest score + correct type)
5. Execute connection

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Connects to "Living Room TV" (correct device)
- ✅ No user clarification needed (intelligent selection)
- ✅ Logs show decision reasoning

**Edge Case Handling:**
```python
# In display_voice_handler.py
def _rank_display_matches(self, matches: List[Tuple[str, float]]) -> str:
    """
    Rank matches by:
    1. Device type (AirPlay display > Audio > Other)
    2. Match score
    3. User history (most recently used)
    """
    # Filter for AirPlay displays first
    display_matches = [
        (name, score) for name, score in matches
        if self._is_airplay_display(name)
    ]

    if display_matches:
        # Return highest scoring AirPlay display
        return max(display_matches, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]

    # Fallback to highest score overall
    return max(matches, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Correct display selected 95% of the time
- Logs explain selection reasoning
- User can override with full name if needed

---

### Scenario 5: Mode Change While Already Connected

**Objective:** Change mirroring mode without disconnecting

**User Action:**
```
User: "Living Room TV"          # Connect
[Wait 2 seconds]
User: "Change to window mode"   # Change mode
```

**System Flow:**
1. First command: Connect to Living Room TV (Entire Screen mode by default)
2. Second command: Detect mode change intent
3. Verify display is already connected
4. Execute mode change flow (5 clicks)
5. Mode switched without disconnection

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Mode changed seamlessly
- ✅ No disconnection/reconnection
- ✅ Window selector appears (for Window mode)
- ✅ Smooth transition (<3 seconds)

**State Management:**
```python
# Track current connection state
self.current_connection = {
    "display_name": "Living Room TV",
    "mode": "entire",
    "connected_at": datetime.now(),
    "coordinates": (1221, 116)
}

# On mode change request
if self.current_connection:
    # Already connected - just change mode
    self._change_mode("window")
else:
    # Not connected - connect first
    self._connect_and_set_mode("Living Room TV", "window")
```

**Success Criteria:**
- No visible disconnection
- Mode change time: < 3 seconds
- Previous window positions preserved

---

### Scenario 6: Rapid Sequential Commands

**Objective:** Handle rapid-fire voice commands without conflicts

**User Action:**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
[Immediately after]
User: "Change to extended"
```

**Challenges:**
- First command still executing
- Second command arrives before completion
- Risk of coordinate conflicts
- Need command queuing

**System Flow:**
1. First command starts: Connection flow
2. Second command arrives (t=0.5s)
3. Command queuing mechanism:
   - Detect ongoing automation
   - Queue second command
   - Wait for first to complete
4. First command completes (t=2.0s)
5. Second command executes (t=2.1s)
6. Both operations successful

**Command Queue Implementation:**
```python
class AutomationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.command_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        self.is_executing = False

    async def execute_command(self, command: Dict):
        # Add to queue
        await self.command_queue.put(command)

        # Start processor if not running
        if not self.is_executing:
            await self._process_queue()

    async def _process_queue(self):
        self.is_executing = True

        while not self.command_queue.empty():
            command = await self.command_queue.get()

            try:
                await self._execute_single_command(command)
                await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Brief pause between commands
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Command failed: {e}")
                # Continue with next command

        self.is_executing = False
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Both commands execute successfully
- ✅ No conflicts or errors
- ✅ Total time: ~4.5 seconds (2s + 0.5s + 2s)
- ✅ User sees queuing notification

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% command success rate
- No coordinate conflicts
- Proper sequencing maintained

## Hard Scenarios

### Scenario 7: Display Disconnects Mid-Operation

**Objective:** Gracefully handle display disconnection during mode change

**User Action:**
```
User: "Change to extended display"
[TV loses power during execution]
```

**Timeline:**
```
t=0.0s: Command received
t=0.5s: Control Center opened
t=1.0s: Screen Mirroring clicked
t=1.5s: Change button clicked
t=1.8s: [TV DISCONNECTS - power outage]
t=2.0s: Extended mode selection (fails)
```

**System Flow:**
1. Mode change starts
2. Display disconnects at t=1.8s
3. Next click fails (display no longer available)
4. Error detection:
   - Display not in available list
   - Connection lost event
5. Graceful degradation:
   - Stop automation
   - Close Control Center
   - Log error with context
   - Notify user

**Error Handling:**
```python
async def _change_mirroring_mode(self, mode: str):
    try:
        # Execute 5-click flow
        await self._click_sequence([
            (CONTROL_CENTER_X, CONTROL_CENTER_Y),
            (SCREEN_MIRRORING_X, SCREEN_MIRRORING_Y),
            (CHANGE_BUTTON_X, CHANGE_BUTTON_Y),
            (mode_x, mode_y),
            (START_MIRRORING_X, START_MIRRORING_Y)
        ])
    except DisplayNotFoundError as e:
        logger.error(f"Display disconnected during mode change: {e}")

        # Clean up
        await self._close_control_center()

        # Notify user
        await self._announce(
            "The display disconnected during mode change. "
            "Please check the connection and try again."
        )

        # Update state
        self.current_connection = None

        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": "display_disconnected",
            "stage": "mode_change"
        }
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Error detected quickly (< 1 second after disconnect)
- ✅ Automation stops immediately
- ✅ User notified with clear message
- ✅ System state cleaned up
- ✅ No hanging UI elements

**Recovery:**
```
User: "Living Room TV"  # Retry after TV powered back on
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Error detection time: < 1 second
- No UI artifacts left behind
- Clean state recovery
- User can retry immediately

### Scenario 8: Control Center UI Changed (macOS Update)

**Objective:** Handle coordinate changes after system update

**User Action:**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
[After macOS update, Control Center moved or redesigned]
```

**Challenges:**
- Coordinates no longer valid
- UI layout changed
- Icons repositioned
- Need adaptive detection

**System Flow:**
1. Command received
2. Click Control Center at (1245, 12)
3. **FAILURE**: Control Center didn't open (new location)
4. Fallback mechanisms:
   - Try alternative Control Center locations
   - Use accessibility API as fallback
   - Self-healing coordinate detection

**Adaptive Coordinate Detection:**
```python
class ControlCenterClicker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coordinate_cache = {}
        self.fallback_methods = [
            self._try_primary_coordinates,
            self._try_scan_for_control_center,
            self._try_accessibility_api,
            self._try_applescript
        ]

    async def open_control_center(self):
        for method in self.fallback_methods:
            try:
                result = await method()
                if result.success:
                    # Cache successful coordinates
                    self._update_coordinate_cache(
                        "control_center",
                        result.coordinates
                    )
                    return result
            except Exception as e:
                logger.debug(f"Method {method.__name__} failed: {e}")
                continue

        # All methods failed
        raise ControlCenterNotFoundError(
            "Could not locate Control Center. "
            "UI may have changed. Please run calibration."
        )

    async def _try_scan_for_control_center(self):
        """
        Scan menu bar for Control Center icon using OCR
        """
        # Capture menu bar screenshot
        screenshot = await self._capture_menu_bar()

        # OCR to find "Control Center" text or icon
        ocr_result = await self._ocr_analyze(screenshot)

        # Find coordinates
        if "Control Center" in ocr_result.text:
            x, y = ocr_result.get_coordinates("Control Center")

            # Click and verify
            await self._click_and_verify(x, y)

            return {
                "success": True,
                "coordinates": (x, y),
                "method": "ocr_scan"
            }
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Primary method fails (expected)
- ✅ Fallback method succeeds
- ✅ New coordinates cached
- ✅ User notified about coordinate update
- ✅ Future commands use new coordinates

**Self-Healing:**
```python
# After successful fallback
logger.info(
    f"Control Center found at new location: ({x}, {y}). "
    f"Updating cached coordinates."
)

# Update config file
self._update_config({
    "control_center": {
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "updated_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "method": "ocr_scan"
    }
})

# Announce to user
await self._announce(
    "I detected Control Center at a new location and updated my settings. "
    "Future commands will use the new coordinates."
)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Fallback success rate: > 90%
- Coordinate update persisted
- No user intervention needed
- Calibration suggestions provided if all methods fail

### Scenario 9: Multiple Displays Available

**Objective:** Handle multiple AirPlay displays simultaneously

**User Action:**
```
User: "Connect to TV"
```

**Available Displays:**
- Living Room TV (Sony BRAVIA)
- Bedroom TV (LG OLED)
- Office Monitor (Dell UltraSharp - not AirPlay)

**Challenges:**
- Ambiguous "TV" reference
- Multiple valid matches
- Need user clarification

**System Flow:**
1. Command received: "Connect to TV"
2. Pattern matching finds:
   - "Living Room TV" (score: 0.7, contains "TV")
   - "Bedroom TV" (score: 0.7, contains "TV")
3. Confidence too low for automatic selection (< 0.8)
4. Request clarification:
   ```
   JARVIS: "I found 2 TVs available:
            1. Living Room TV
            2. Bedroom TV
            Which one would you like to connect to?"
   ```
5. User responds: "Living Room"
6. Refined match → "Living Room TV"
7. Execute connection

**Clarification Logic:**
```python
async def _handle_ambiguous_display(self, query: str, matches: List[Tuple[str, float]]):
    """Handle multiple equally-valid matches"""

    # Filter high-confidence matches (score > 0.6)
    high_confidence = [
        (name, score) for name, score in matches
        if score > 0.6
    ]

    if len(high_confidence) == 1:
        # Only one high-confidence match - use it
        return high_confidence[0][0]

    elif len(high_confidence) > 1:
        # Multiple high-confidence matches - need clarification

        # Check if scores are significantly different
        max_score = max(score for _, score in high_confidence)
        second_score = sorted(high_confidence, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[1][1]

        if max_score - second_score > 0.2:
            # Clear winner - use it
            return max(high_confidence, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]

        # Scores too close - ask user
        display_list = "\n".join([
            f"   {i+1}. {name}"
            for i, (name, _) in enumerate(high_confidence)
        ])

        clarification = f"""I found {len(high_confidence)} displays available:
{display_list}
Which one would you like to connect to?"""

        # Use contextual resolver for follow-up
        return await self._request_clarification(clarification, high_confidence)

    else:
        # No high-confidence matches
        return None
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Ambiguity detected
- ✅ Clear clarification request
- ✅ Numbered list of options
- ✅ Follow-up command handled
- ✅ Correct display selected

**Success Criteria:**
- Clarification rate: < 10% (most queries unambiguous)
- Clarification response time: < 500ms
- Follow-up success rate: > 95%

## Complex Edge Cases

### Scenario 10: Display Name Contains Special Characters

**Objective:** Handle displays with Unicode, emojis, or special characters

**Display Names:**
- "Living Room TV 📺"
- "John's MacBook Pro"
- "Office Display (4K)"
- "会議室モニター" (Japanese: Conference Room Monitor)

**User Action:**
```
User: "Living Room"
```

**Challenges:**
- Emoji in display name
- Pattern matching must handle Unicode
- Coordinate clicking must encode correctly
- Voice input might not include emoji

**System Flow:**
1. Voice input: "Living Room" (no emoji)
2. Available displays:
   - "Living Room TV 📺"
3. Pattern matching:
   - Normalize both strings (remove emoji/special chars)
   - "Living Room" matches "Living Room TV"
4. Select display (with emoji preserved)
5. Click coordinates for "Living Room TV 📺"
6. Connection successful

**Normalization:**
```python
import unicodedata
import re

def normalize_display_name(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Normalize display name for matching
    - Remove emojis
    - Remove special punctuation
    - Normalize Unicode (NFD)
    - Lowercase
    """
    # Remove emojis
    emoji_pattern = re.compile(
        "["
        "\U0001F600-\U0001F64F"  # emoticons
        "\U0001F300-\U0001F5FF"  # symbols & pictographs
        "\U0001F680-\U0001F6FF"  # transport & map symbols
        "\U0001F1E0-\U0001F1FF"  # flags
        "]+",
        flags=re.UNICODE
    )
    name = emoji_pattern.sub('', name)

    # Normalize Unicode
    name = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', name)

    # Remove non-alphanumeric (keep spaces)
    name = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', name)

    # Lowercase and strip
    return name.lower().strip()

def match_display_name(query: str, display_name: str) -> float:
    """
    Match user query to display name
    Returns confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)
    """
    # Normalize both
    norm_query = normalize_display_name(query)
    norm_display = normalize_display_name(display_name)

    # Exact match
    if norm_query == norm_display:
        return 1.0

    # Substring match
    if norm_query in norm_display:
        return 0.9

    # Word-by-word match
    query_words = set(norm_query.split())
    display_words = set(norm_display.split())

    common_words = query_words & display_words
    if common_words:
        return len(common_words) / len(query_words) * 0.8

    # Fuzzy match (Levenshtein distance)
    from difflib import SequenceMatcher
    similarity = SequenceMatcher(None, norm_query, norm_display).ratio()

    return similarity * 0.7
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Special characters handled correctly
- ✅ Emoji preserved in display name
- ✅ Pattern matching works despite differences
- ✅ Connection successful

**User Action:**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
```

**Network Conditions:**
- High WiFi latency (200ms+)
- Packet loss (5-10%)
- Congested network

**Timeline:**
```
t=0.0s: Command received
t=0.5s: Control Center opened
t=1.0s: Screen Mirroring clicked
t=1.5s: Living Room TV clicked
t=2.0s: [Waiting for AirPlay handshake...]
t=4.0s: [Still waiting...]
t=6.0s: [Still waiting...]
t=8.0s: Connection established (slower than normal)
```

**System Flow:**
1. Execute 3-click flow (normal speed)
2. AirPlay handshake starts
3. Detect slow connection:
   - Expected: 2-3 seconds
   - Actual: > 5 seconds
4. Provide interim feedback:
   ```
   JARVIS: "Connection in progress... Network seems slow."
   ```
5. Wait with timeout (15 seconds max)
6. Connection succeeds at t=8s
7. Announce success

**Timeout Handling:**
```python
async def connect_display(self, display_name: str, timeout: int = 15):
    """
    Connect to display with timeout

    Args:
        display_name: Name of display to connect
        timeout: Maximum wait time (seconds)
    """
    start_time = datetime.now()

    # Execute click sequence
    await self._execute_connection_clicks(display_name)

    # Wait for connection with progress updates
    connection_established = False
    last_update = start_time

    while not connection_established:
        elapsed = (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds()

        # Timeout check
        if elapsed > timeout:
            raise ConnectionTimeoutError(
                f"Connection to {display_name} timed out after {timeout}s. "
                f"Check network connection and display power."
            )

        # Interim updates every 3 seconds
        if (datetime.now() - last_update).total_seconds() > 3:
            await self._announce(
                f"Still connecting... ({int(elapsed)} seconds)"
            )
            last_update = datetime.now()

        # Check if connected
        connection_established = await self._verify_connection(display_name)

        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

    total_time = (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds()

    # Log slow connection
    if total_time > 5:
        logger.warning(
            f"Slow connection detected: {total_time:.1f}s. "
            f"Normal: 2-3s. Check network."
        )

### Scenario 12: Display Powers On Mid-Command

**Objective:** Handle display that becomes available while command is executing

**User Action:**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
[TV is currently off]
```

**Timeline:**
```
t=0.0s: Command received
t=0.5s: Check available displays
        Result: Living Room TV not found
t=1.0s: Error: "Living Room TV is not available"
t=1.5s: [User powers on TV manually]
t=2.0s: TV boots up
t=3.0s: TV joins network
t=3.5s: Living Room TV now available
```

**System Flow (Smart Retry):**
1. Initial attempt fails (TV off)
2. Error detected: Display not available
3. Smart retry logic:
   - Wait 3 seconds (allow for boot time)
   - Re-scan for displays
   - Retry connection if display appears
4. Display found at t=3.5s
5. Retry connection automatically
6. Success at t=4.0s

**Smart Retry Implementation:**
```python
async def connect_with_smart_retry(
    self,
    display_name: str,
    max_retries: int = 2,
    retry_delay: int = 3
):
    """
    Connect with smart retry logic for displays that might power on

    Args:
        display_name: Target display
        max_retries: Number of retry attempts
        retry_delay: Seconds to wait between retries
    """
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        try:
            # Check if display is available
            available = await self._scan_for_display(display_name)

            if not available:
                if attempt < max_retries:
                    # Display not found - might be booting up
                    await self._announce(
                        f"{display_name} is not available. "
                        f"Waiting {retry_delay} seconds in case it's powering on..."
                    )

                    await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay)

                    # Re-scan
                    logger.info(f"Retry {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}: Re-scanning for {display_name}")
                    continue
                else:
                    # Final attempt failed
                    raise DisplayNotFoundError(
                        f"{display_name} is not available. "
                        f"Please ensure it's powered on and connected to the network."
                    )

            # Display found - attempt connection
            result = await self._connect_to_display(display_name)

            if result.success:
                # Success
                if attempt > 0:
                    logger.info(
                        f"Connection succeeded on retry {attempt + 1}. "
                        f"Display likely powered on during wait."
                    )

                return result

        except ConnectionError as e:
            if attempt < max_retries:
                logger.warning(f"Connection attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay)
            else:
                raise
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Initial failure detected
- ✅ Smart retry initiated
- ✅ Display discovered on retry
- ✅ Connection succeeds automatically
- ✅ User informed throughout

**Success Criteria:**
- Retry success rate: > 70% (displays that power on)
- Total time: < 10 seconds
- User kept informed
- No infinite loops

## Ambiguity & Nuances

### Nuance 1: "TV" vs "Display" vs "Monitor"

**Challenge:** Different terms for the same concept

**User Variations:**
```
"Connect to TV"
"Connect to the television"
"Show on the monitor"
"Mirror to the display"
"Cast to the screen"
```

**System Handling:**
```python
# Synonym mapping
DISPLAY_SYNONYMS = {
    "tv": ["tv", "television", "telly"],
    "monitor": ["monitor", "screen", "display"],
    "projector": ["projector", "proj"],
}

def expand_query_with_synonyms(query: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Expand query with synonyms for better matching

    Example:
        "Connect to TV" → ["Connect to TV", "Connect to television", "Connect to telly"]
    """
    expanded = [query]

    for synonym_group in DISPLAY_SYNONYMS.values():
        for synonym in synonym_group:
            if synonym in query.lower():
                # Replace with other synonyms
                for alt_synonym in synonym_group:
                    if alt_synonym != synonym:
                        expanded.append(
                            query.lower().replace(synonym, alt_synonym)
                        )

    return expanded
```

**Success:** Pattern matching handles all variations

---

### Nuance 2: Partial Display Names

**Challenge:** Users often use shortened names

**Full Name:** "Living Room Sony BRAVIA 4K TV"

**User Variations:**
```
"Living Room TV"        → Should match (common usage)
"Sony TV"               → Should match (brand reference)
"Living Room"           → Should match (location)
"BRAVIA"                → Should match (model)
"4K TV"                 → Ambiguous (might match multiple)
```

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```python
def score_partial_match(query: str, full_name: str) -> float:
    """
    Score partial name matches

    Priorities:
    1. Location (Living Room) - 0.9
    2. Brand (Sony) - 0.8
    3. Type (TV) - 0.7
    4. Model (BRAVIA) - 0.6
    5. Feature (4K) - 0.5
    """
    query_lower = query.lower()
    name_lower = full_name.lower()

    # Extract components
    location = extract_location(name_lower)  # "Living Room"
    brand = extract_brand(name_lower)        # "Sony"
    type_name = extract_type(name_lower)     # "TV"
    model = extract_model(name_lower)        # "BRAVIA"
    features = extract_features(name_lower)  # ["4K"]

    score = 0.0

    # Location match (highest priority)
    if location and location in query_lower:
        score = max(score, 0.9)

    # Brand match
    if brand and brand in query_lower:
        score = max(score, 0.8)

    # Type match
    if type_name and type_name in query_lower:
        score = max(score, 0.7)

    # Model match
    if model and model in query_lower:
        score = max(score, 0.6)

    # Feature match (lowest priority - often ambiguous)
    for feature in features:
        if feature in query_lower:
            score = max(score, 0.5)

    return score
```

**Result:** Intelligent partial matching with priority weighting

---

### Nuance 3: Implied Actions

**Challenge:** Users often imply the action without stating it

**Explicit:**
```
"Connect to Living Room TV"          ✓ Clear action
"Change to extended display"         ✓ Clear action
"Stop screen mirroring"              ✓ Clear action
```

**Implicit:**
```
"Living Room TV"                     → Implies "connect"
"Extended display"                   → Implies "change to"
"Turn off mirroring"                 → Implies "stop"
```

**Intent Detection:**
```python
def detect_implied_intent(query: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Detect implied action from query

    Returns:
        (action, target)
    """
    query_lower = query.lower()

    # Pattern 1: Just display name → CONNECT
    if self._is_display_name_only(query):
        return ("connect", query)

    # Pattern 2: "Extended" or mode name → CHANGE_MODE
    mode_keywords = ["extended", "mirror", "window", "entire"]
    for mode in mode_keywords:
        if mode in query_lower:
            if "change" not in query_lower and "switch" not in query_lower:
                # Implied change
                return ("change_mode", mode)

    # Pattern 3: "Off" or "stop" → DISCONNECT
    stop_keywords = ["off", "stop", "disconnect", "turn off"]
    if any(kw in query_lower for kw in stop_keywords):
        return ("disconnect", "")

    # Pattern 4: Explicit action present
    if "connect" in query_lower or "show" in query_lower or "mirror" in query_lower:
        return ("connect", self._extract_display_name(query))

    # Default: assume connect
    return ("connect", query)
```

**Result:** Natural language understanding for minimal commands

---

### Nuance 4: Time-Dependent Behavior

**Challenge:** Same command might mean different things at different times

**Morning (6 AM - 12 PM):**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
Context: Likely checking news, watching morning shows
Suggestion: Mirror entire screen (default)
```

**Afternoon (12 PM - 6 PM):**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
Context: Working from home, presentations
Suggestion: Extended display (productivity)
```

**Evening (6 PM - 12 AM):**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
Context: Entertainment, streaming
Suggestion: Mirror entire screen
```

**Late Night (12 AM - 6 AM):**
```
User: "Living Room TV"
Context: Rare usage, might be urgent
Suggestion: Confirm intent before connecting
```

**Time-Aware Defaults:**
```python
from datetime import datetime

def get_time_based_default_mode(self) -> str:
    """
    Suggest default mode based on time of day

    Returns:
        Suggested mode: "entire", "extended", or "window"
    """
    hour = datetime.now().hour

    # Morning: News/Info (Mirror)
    if 6 <= hour < 12:
        return "entire"

    # Afternoon: Work (Extended)
    elif 12 <= hour < 18:
        return "extended"

    # Evening: Entertainment (Mirror)
    elif 18 <= hour < 24:
        return "entire"

    # Late Night: Confirm first
    else:
        # Special case: ask for confirmation
        return "confirm_first"

async def connect_with_time_awareness(self, display_name: str):
    """Connect with time-based intelligent defaults"""

    default_mode = self.get_time_based_default_mode()

    if default_mode == "confirm_first":
        # Late night - confirm intent
        response = await self._ask_confirmation(
            f"It's late ({datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p')}). "
            f"Do you want to connect to {display_name}?"
        )

        if not response:
            return {"success": False, "cancelled": True}

    # Connect with suggested mode
    await self.connect_and_set_mode(display_name, default_mode)
```

**Result:** Context-aware behavior without explicit user configuration
