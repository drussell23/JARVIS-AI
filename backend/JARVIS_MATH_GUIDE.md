# 🧮 JARVIS Enhanced Mathematical Capabilities

## Overview
JARVIS has been enhanced to better handle mathematical questions through improved LangChain integration and smarter pattern detection.

## ✨ What's New

### 1. **Better Math Detection**
JARVIS now recognizes math questions more reliably:
- Detects numbers + math patterns
- Recognizes word-based operations ("plus", "minus", "times", etc.)
- Handles questions like "What is 2+2?" correctly

### 2. **Enhanced Calculator Tool**
The Calculator tool now supports:
- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Word operations: "plus", "minus", "times", "divided by"
- Powers: "squared", "cubed", "to the power of"
- Natural language: "What is...", "Calculate...", "Compute..."
- Clean number formatting (shows 4 instead of 4.0)

### 3. **Improved Agent Prompt**
The LangChain agent now has explicit instructions to:
- ALWAYS use Calculator for math
- Use appropriate tools for different query types
- Provide cleaner, more direct answers

## 📝 Examples That Now Work

### Basic Math
- ✅ "What is 2+2?"
- ✅ "Calculate 15 * 23 + 47"
- ✅ "What's 100 divided by 4?"

### Word-Based Math
- ✅ "5 plus 5 times 2"
- ✅ "10 squared"
- ✅ "2 to the power of 8"

### Natural Language
- ✅ "How much is 50 minus 30?"
- ✅ "Can you compute 1000 / 25?"
- ✅ "What's the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5?"

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Pattern Detection**: Enhanced to detect math expressions better
   ```python
   math_patterns = [
       "calculate", "what is", "what's", "how much", "compute",
       "+", "-", "*", "/", "plus", "minus", "times", "divided"
   ]
   ```

2. **Smart Routing**: Routes math questions to the LangChain agent
   ```python
   if (has_numbers and has_math_pattern):
       # Use agent with Calculator tool
   ```

3. **Clean Calculation**: Calculator handles natural language
   ```python
   "what is 2+2" → "2+2" → 4
   "5 plus 5" → "5 + 5" → 10
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

To ensure JARVIS uses LangChain for math:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export USE_DYNAMIC_CHATBOT=1
   export FORCE_LLAMA=1
   ```

2. **Memory Requirements**:
   - LangChain mode activates when memory < 50%
   - Ensure sufficient memory is available

3. **Start the System**:
   ```bash
   python start_system.py --skip-install
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

Test the enhanced math capabilities:
```bash
cd backend
python test_math_enhanced.py
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Be Clear**: "What is 2+2?" works better than just "2+2"
2. **Use Keywords**: Include "calculate", "what is", etc.
3. **Complex Math**: Can handle multi-step calculations
4. **Word Problems**: Supports natural language math

## 🎯 Result

JARVIS can now:
- ✅ Answer "What is 2+2?" correctly (returns: 4)
- ✅ Handle complex calculations
- ✅ Understand word-based math
- ✅ Provide clean, formatted answers

The system intelligently uses the Calculator tool through LangChain, providing accurate mathematical results while maintaining the conversational interface.
