# Multi-Space Vision Error Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. AttributeError: 'PureVisionIntelligence' object has no attribute 'capture_engine'
**Cause**: The capture_engine was not being initialized in PureVisionIntelligence
**Fix**: Added capture_engine initialization in __init__ method:
```python
# Initialize capture engine
try:
    from vision.multi_space_capture_engine import MultiSpaceCaptureEngine
    self.capture_engine = MultiSpaceCaptureEngine()
    # Connect optimizer to capture engine if both available
    if self.multi_space_optimizer and self.capture_engine:
        self.capture_engine.optimizer = self.multi_space_optimizer
        self.multi_space_optimizer.capture_engine = self.capture_engine
    logger.info("Multi-space capture engine initialized")
except ImportError:
    logger.warning("Multi-space capture engine not available")
```

### 2. AttributeError: 'SpaceInfo' object has no attribute 'get'
**Cause**: Code was trying to use .get() method on SpaceInfo objects which are not dictionaries
**Fix**: Updated all space.get() calls to handle both objects and dictionaries:
```python
# Before:
space.get('cached_screenshot')

# After:
(hasattr(space, 'cached_screenshot') and space.cached_screenshot) if hasattr(space, 'cached_screenshot') 
else (isinstance(space, dict) and space.get('cached_screenshot'))
```

### 3. Purple Indicator Integration
**Enhancement**: Integrated the existing purple indicator monitoring system with multi-space vision
**Benefits**:
- Visual feedback when monitoring is active
- Single permission grant for all spaces
- Efficient multi-space captures using existing session

## How to Test

1. **Restart JARVIS Backend**
   ```bash
   # Stop any existing backend
   ps aux | grep "python.*main.py" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   
   # Start fresh
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enable Screen Recording Permission**
   - System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording
   - Add Terminal (or your terminal app) to allowed list
   - Restart Terminal if needed

3. **Test Multi-Space Vision**
   ```
   User: "Hey JARVIS, start monitoring my screen"
   # Wait for purple indicator to appear
   
   User: "Where is Terminal?"
   # Should search across all desktop spaces
   
   User: "Stop monitoring"
   # Purple indicator should disappear
   ```

## Expected Results

When working correctly:
- Purple indicator appears when monitoring starts
- Multi-space queries like "Where is Terminal?" work without errors
- JARVIS can find apps across all desktop spaces
- No ValueError or AttributeError messages
- Purple indicator disappears when monitoring stops

## Troubleshooting

If still getting ValueError:
1. Make sure backend was fully restarted
2. Check screen recording permissions
3. Run test script: `python test_multi_space_fix.py`

If purple indicator doesn't appear:
1. Check Swift capture is available: `ls vision/persistent_capture.swift`
2. Verify permissions in System Preferences

## Technical Details

The multi-space vision system now:
- Initializes capture_engine properly in PureVisionIntelligence
- Handles both SpaceInfo objects and dictionaries throughout
- Integrates with existing purple indicator monitoring
- Uses active monitoring session for efficient multi-space captures
- Provides clear error messages when permissions are missing
