# ✅ Lock Command is Now Fixed!

## The Problem
When you said "lock my screen", JARVIS responded:
> "I couldn't lock the screen, Sir. Not connected to Voice Unlock"

## The Solution
I've updated the Voice Unlock integration to use Context Intelligence as a fallback:

1. **If Voice Unlock daemon is running**: Uses Voice Unlock (faster)
2. **If Voice Unlock daemon is NOT running**: Uses Context Intelligence (AppleScript/pmset)

## What Changed

In `api/voice_unlock_integration.py`:

```python
# OLD: Only tried Voice Unlock, failed if not connected
if not voice_unlock_connector or not voice_unlock_connector.connected:
    await initialize_voice_unlock()
    
result = await voice_unlock_connector.send_command("lock_screen", ...)

# NEW: Tries Voice Unlock first, then falls back to Context Intelligence
if voice_unlock_connector and voice_unlock_connector.connected:
    # Try Voice Unlock first
    result = await voice_unlock_connector.send_command("lock_screen", ...)
    if result and result.get('success'):
        return success
        
# Fallback to Context Intelligence
from context_intelligence.core.unlock_manager import get_unlock_manager
unlock_manager = get_unlock_manager()
success, message = await unlock_manager.lock_screen("User command from JARVIS")
```

## How It Works Now

### Case 1: Voice Unlock Daemon Running
```
You: "lock my screen"
JARVIS: "Locking your screen now, Sir." (via Voice Unlock)
Result: Screen locks immediately
```

### Case 2: Voice Unlock Daemon NOT Running
```
You: "lock my screen"
JARVIS: "Screen locked successfully, Sir." (via Context Intelligence)
Result: Screen locks using AppleScript (Cmd+Ctrl+Q) or pmset
```

## Test It Yourself

1. **With Voice Unlock daemon running** (current state):
   - Say "lock my screen"
   - Should work instantly

2. **Without Voice Unlock daemon**:
   - Stop the daemon: `pkill -f websocket_server`
   - Say "lock my screen"  
   - Should still work via Context Intelligence

## Integration Complete

Both lock and unlock commands now have intelligent fallback:
- ✅ Lock screen - Works with or without Voice Unlock
- ✅ Unlock screen - Works with or without Voice Unlock
- ✅ Context Intelligence - Ready for locked screen scenarios
- ✅ No more "Not connected to Voice Unlock" errors!

The Context Intelligence System provides a reliable fallback for all screen lock/unlock operations!
