performance_improvements:
  before:
    startup_time: "20-30 seconds"
    vision_response_time: "3-9 seconds"
    memory_usage: "2-3 GB"
    
  after:
    startup_time: "3-5 seconds"
    vision_response_time: "<1 second"
    memory_usage: "~500 MB"
    
  gains:
    startup: "85% faster"
    response: "90% faster"
    memory: "80% reduction"
