# 🔐 Context-Aware Screen Unlock Implementation for JARVIS

## Overview
JARVIS now has full context awareness to automatically detect when your screen is locked and unlock it before executing commands that require screen access.

## How It Works

### 1. Command Reception
When you say: **"Hey JARVIS, open Safari and search for dogs"**

### 2. Context Analysis
JARVIS analyzes the command:
- ✅ Detects this command requires screen access
- ✅ Checks if the screen is currently locked
- ✅ Determines unlock is needed

### 3. User Communication
JARVIS responds:
> "I see your screen is locked. I'll unlock it now by typing in your password so I can search for dogs."

### 4. Automatic Unlock
- Retrieves password from macOS Keychain
- Types password into lock screen (with enhanced timing)
- Presses Enter to unlock

### 5. Command Execution
- Waits for unlock to complete (2 seconds)
- Executes original command: Opens Safari and searches for dogs
- Provides step-by-step feedback

### 6. Confirmation
JARVIS confirms:
> "I see your screen is locked. I'll unlock it now by typing in your password so I can search for dogs. I've opened Safari and searched for dogs as requested."

## Key Components

### 1. **Enhanced Context Handler** (`simple_context_handler_enhanced.py`)
- Detects commands requiring screen access
- Checks screen lock state
- Provides clear user feedback
- Tracks execution steps

### 2. **Direct Unlock Handler** (`direct_unlock_handler_fixed.py`)
- Communicates with Voice Unlock WebSocket server
- Sends correct message format
- Handles unlock operations

### 3. **JARVIS Voice API Integration**
- Uses enhanced context handler for all commands
- Sends real-time updates via WebSocket
- Provides execution step tracking

## Commands That Trigger Context-Aware Unlock

### Browser Operations
- "Open Safari and search for..."
- "Google something"
- "Go to website.com"

### Application Control
- "Open [App Name]"
- "Launch [Application]"
- "Show me [App]"

### File Operations
- "Create a document"
- "Open a file"
- "Save this"

### UI Interactions
- "Click on..."
- "Type..."
- "Take a screenshot"

## Commands That DON'T Require Unlock
- "What time is it?"
- "What's the weather?"
- "Lock my screen"
- "Play/pause music"
- "Volume control"

## Testing

### 1. Test Context Detection
```bash
cd backend
python3 test_context_aware_unlock.py
```

### 2. Test with JARVIS Running
1. Start JARVIS:
   ```bash
   python3 start_system.py
   ```

2. Lock your screen (Cmd+Ctrl+Q)

3. Say: "Hey JARVIS, open Safari and search for dogs"

4. Watch JARVIS:
   - Detect locked screen
   - Announce unlock intention
   - Unlock screen
   - Execute command
   - Confirm completion

## Configuration

### Screen Detection Patterns
Edit `backend/api/simple_context_handler_enhanced.py`:
```python
self.screen_required_patterns = [
    # Add your patterns here
]
```

### Timing Configuration
- Wake delay: 2.0 seconds
- Typing speed: 200ms per character
- Post-unlock wait: 2.0 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Screen Not Detected as Locked
- Check Voice Unlock daemon is running (port 8765)
- Verify screen lock detection: `python3 test_context_aware_unlock.py`

### 2. Unlock Fails
- Verify password is stored: `security find-generic-password -s com.jarvis.voiceunlock -a unlock_token -w`
- Check WebSocket connection to port 8765
- Review logs for timing issues

### 3. Command Not Recognized as Needing Screen
- Add pattern to `screen_required_patterns`
- Check command text in logs

## Security Notes

1. **Password is stored securely** in macOS Keychain
2. **Context awareness only activates** for commands needing screen
3. **Clear communication** before any unlock attempt
4. **No silent unlocking** - always announces intention

## Future Enhancements

1. **Learning System**: JARVIS learns which commands need screen
2. **Smart Delays**: Adaptive timing based on system performance
3. **Multi-Step Commands**: Handle complex workflows
4. **Preference Learning**: Remember user preferences

## Summary

JARVIS now intelligently handles screen lock context:
- ✅ Detects when screen is locked
- ✅ Communicates clearly with user
- ✅ Unlocks screen automatically
- ✅ Executes commands seamlessly
- ✅ Provides step-by-step feedback

**Your screen lock is no longer a barrier - JARVIS handles it transparently!**
