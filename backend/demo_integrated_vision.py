ü§ñ JARVIS Integrated Vision & Control System Demo
================================================

This system integrates:
‚Ä¢ Proactive Vision Analysis
‚Ä¢ Dynamic Multi-Window Detection  
‚Ä¢ Notification Monitoring
‚Ä¢ Contextual Voice Responses
‚Ä¢ Intelligent Reply Suggestions

Key Features:

1. PROACTIVE SCREEN DESCRIPTION:
   When you ask "What's on my screen?", JARVIS will:
   - Describe what you're currently looking at
   - Mention other open windows/applications
   - Alert you to any notifications
   - Offer to describe specific areas

2. NOTIFICATION HANDLING:
   When WhatsApp (or any app) shows a notification:
   - JARVIS verbally announces: "Sir, you have a message from WhatsApp"
   - Offers to read the message
   - Provides contextual reply options based on:
     ‚Ä¢ Time of day
     ‚Ä¢ Your current activity
     ‚Ä¢ Past interaction patterns
   
3. INTELLIGENT REPLIES:
   Based on context, JARVIS suggests replies like:
   - During work: "In a meeting, will respond soon"
   - Evening: "Will look at this tomorrow"
   - Coding: "Deep in code, will check in a bit"

4. SEAMLESS INTEGRATION:
   Vision ‚Üê‚Üí Voice ‚Üê‚Üí Control work together:
   - See notification ‚Üí Announce it ‚Üí Read it ‚Üí Help reply
   - All with zero hardcoding!

Example Interaction:
===================

User: "What can you see on my screen?"

JARVIS: "You're working in Cursor on dynamic_vision_engine.py ‚Äî JARVIS-AI-Agent.

I also notice you have Terminal, Chrome, and WhatsApp running.

Sir, you have a new message from WhatsApp.
Would you like me to read it to you?

I can describe any specific part of your screen in more detail.
Just let me know what you'd like to focus on."

User: "Read the WhatsApp message"

JARVIS: "The message from WhatsApp says:
'Hey, are you free for a quick call?'

Would you like to reply?"

User: "Yes, help me reply"

JARVIS: "I can help you reply to WhatsApp.
Based on your past interactions, here are some suggestions:
1. Give me 5 minutes
2. In a meeting, will call you back
3. Can we talk later?
4. Sure, calling now
5. Deep in code, will check in a bit

Or you can dictate a custom message."

ALL DYNAMIC - NO HARDCODING!
============================

The system learns and adapts:
‚Ä¢ Discovers apps dynamically
‚Ä¢ Learns your reply patterns
‚Ä¢ Adapts to your schedule
‚Ä¢ Improves with usage

This creates a truly intelligent AI assistant that:
- Proactively helps with notifications
- Understands context
- Communicates naturally
- Gets smarter over time
