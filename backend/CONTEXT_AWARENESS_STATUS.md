# Context Awareness Implementation Status

## What We've Implemented

1. **Simple Context Handler** (`api/simple_context_handler.py`)
   - Detects commands that require screen access
   - Checks if screen is locked before executing
   - Automatically unlocks screen when needed
   - Provides appropriate feedback to user

2. **Direct Unlock Handler** (`api/direct_unlock_handler.py`)
   - Communicates with voice unlock daemon
   - Checks screen lock status
   - Sends unlock commands

3. **WebSocket Integration** (`api/jarvis_voice_api.py`)
   - Modified to use context awareness for all commands
   - Routes commands through context handler first
   - Falls back to workflow processing if needed

## Current Status

✅ Backend Implementation Complete
- Context awareness system is implemented
- WebSocket handler is configured to use it
- Debug logging is in place

❌ Frontend Connection Issue
- Frontend is NOT connecting to JARVIS WebSocket endpoint
- Only wake-word and ML audio WebSockets are connected
- JARVIS WebSocket at `/voice/jarvis/stream` has no connections

## Testing Instructions

1. **Ensure Backend is Running**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/derekjrussell/Documents/repos/JARVIS-AI-Agent/backend
   tail -f jarvis_backend.log | grep -E "JARVIS WS|CONTEXT|WebSocket.*jarvis"
   ```

2. **Test with Direct Script**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/derekjrussell/Documents/repos/JARVIS-AI-Agent/backend
   python test_context_directly.py
   ```

3. **Check Frontend**
   - Open browser console in React app
   - Look for WebSocket connection errors
   - Check if JARVIS status is being fetched
   - Try saying "Hey JARVIS" to see if it responds

## Expected Behavior

When screen is locked and user says "open Safari and search for dogs":

1. JARVIS detects screen is locked
2. Says: "Your screen is locked. I'll unlock it now by typing in the password."
3. Unlocks the screen
4. Opens Safari and performs search
5. Confirms actions taken

## Troubleshooting

If not working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh React app (Cmd+R)
3. Check backend log for WebSocket connections
4. Verify JARVIS API is responding: `curl http://localhost:8000/voice/jarvis/status`

## Debug Commands

Monitor backend for context activity:
```bash
tail -f jarvis_backend.log | grep -E "CONTEXT|JARVIS WS|WebSocket received command"
```

Test WebSocket directly:
```bash
python test_context_directly.py
```
