# ✅ Context Intelligence System - SCENARIO READY

## The Exact PRD Scenario is Now Fully Implemented!

### Scenario: Mac is locked, user says "JARVIS, open Safari and search for dogs"

Here's exactly what happens:

## 1. **JARVIS Detects State = LOCKED** ✅
```python
# screen_state.py detects using multiple methods:
- Quartz API check
- IORegistry check  
- PMSet sleepstate check
- Process monitoring fallback
```

## 2. **Queues Request** ✅
```python
# command_queue.py stores:
{
    "command_id": "uuid-here",
    "original_text": "open Safari and search for dogs",
    "intent": {"action": "open_and_search", "target": "Safari"},
    "priority": "NORMAL",
    "requires_screen": true,
    "status": "PENDING"
}
```

## 3. **Feedback: "Your screen is locked, unlocking now"** ✅
```python
# feedback_manager.py generates natural language:
- "I see your screen is locked. Let me unlock it for you..."
- "Unlocking your screen now..."
- Progress updates via WebSocket
```

## 4. **Unlock Manager Runs** ✅
```python
# unlock_manager.py attempts unlock:
1. Retrieves password from Keychain
2. Tries AppleScript method first
3. Falls back to other methods if needed
4. Tracks success/failure
```

## 5. **Logs Unlock Success/Failure** ✅
```python
# On success:
- unlock_success event logged
- Statistics updated
- Queue status changes to PROCESSING

# On failure:
- unlock_failed event logged
- User prompted to unlock manually
- Command remains queued
```

## 6. **JARVIS Resumes Queued Request** ✅
```python
# context_manager.py state machine:
CHECKING_PREREQUISITES → AWAITING_UNLOCK → UNLOCKING → EXECUTING → COMPLETED
```

## 7. **Execution Layer Opens Safari & Searches** ✅
```python
# unified_command_executor.py:
- Processes "open Safari and search for dogs"
- Routes to unified_command_processor
- Safari opens, search executes
```

## 8. **Feedback: "I unlocked your screen, opened Safari, and searched for dogs"** ✅
```python
# Final feedback includes:
- Unlock confirmation
- Action completion  
- Natural, conversational tone
```

## Complete Flow Trace

```
User: "JARVIS, open Safari and search for dogs" (screen locked)
         ↓
jarvis_voice_api.py 
         ↓
enhanced_context_wrapper.py (Context Intelligence)
         ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  1. screen_state.py → LOCKED detected  │
    │  2. command_queue.py → Command queued  │
    │  3. feedback_manager.py → "Locked..."  │
    │  4. policy_engine.py → AUTO_UNLOCK     │
    │  5. unlock_manager.py → Unlock screen  │
    │  6. context_manager.py → Execute       │
    │  7. feedback_manager.py → "Success!"   │
    └────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
unified_command_processor.py
         ↓
Safari opens and searches for "dogs"
```

## Testing the Scenario

### Quick Test:
```bash
# This will lock screen and simulate the exact scenario
python demo_locked_screen_scenario.py
```

### Detailed Test:
```bash
# Shows all components working together
python test_complete_scenario.py
```

### Live Test:
1. Lock your Mac screen (Cmd+Ctrl+Q)
2. Say: "JARVIS, open Safari and search for dogs"
3. Watch the magic happen!

## Requirements Met

✅ **State Detection** - Multiple methods ensure accurate lock detection
✅ **Command Queuing** - Persistent queue with priority handling  
✅ **User Feedback** - Natural language at every step
✅ **Auto Unlock** - Policy-based intelligent decisions
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks and recovery
✅ **Command Execution** - Original intent preserved and executed
✅ **Complete Integration** - Drop-in replacement, no changes to JARVIS needed

## Configuration Required

### One-Time Password Storage:
```python
from context_intelligence.core.unlock_manager import get_unlock_manager
manager = get_unlock_manager()
manager.store_password("your_password")
print("✓ Password stored in Keychain")
```

### That's It! 
The system is ready to handle your exact scenario and many more!

## What Makes This Special

1. **It Just Works™** - No configuration files, no complex setup
2. **Intelligent Fallbacks** - Multiple methods ensure reliability
3. **Natural Conversation** - JARVIS speaks like a helpful assistant
4. **Secure** - Password in Keychain, policy controls
5. **Extensible** - Easy to add new commands and behaviors

The Context Intelligence System is now fully operational and ready to make JARVIS truly context-aware!
