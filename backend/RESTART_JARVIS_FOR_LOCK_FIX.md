# ðŸ”„ RESTART JARVIS TO LOAD THE LOCK FIX

## The Problem
JARVIS has been running since 3:28 AM and hasn't loaded the updated code that fixes the lock command.

## The Solution is Already Implemented
âœ… The code is fixed and working
âœ… Lock commands now fall back to Context Intelligence when Voice Unlock isn't available
âœ… Tests confirm it works

## You Just Need to Restart JARVIS

### Option 1: Quick Restart
```bash
# Kill the current JARVIS process
pkill -f "python main.py"

# Start JARVIS again
cd ~/Documents/repos/JARVIS-AI-Agent/backend
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Graceful Restart
1. Say "Hey JARVIS, goodbye" or "JARVIS, shut down"
2. Wait for it to shut down
3. Start it again with `python main.py`

## After Restart

Try saying "lock my screen" and it should work! You'll get one of these responses:

- If Voice Unlock is connected: "Locking your screen now, Sir."
- If Voice Unlock is NOT connected: "Screen locked successfully, Sir."

Either way, your screen will lock successfully!

## Why This Happened

1. You had JARVIS running since early morning
2. We made code changes to fix the lock command
3. JARVIS was still using the old code
4. A restart loads the new code with the fix

The Context Intelligence System is ready and working - you just need to restart JARVIS to use it!
