# JARVIS Voice Unlock with Apple Watch Integration

## Overview

The JARVIS Voice Unlock system now features complete Apple Watch proximity detection integrated with voice authentication. This provides a seamless and secure authentication experience that combines:

1. **Apple Watch Proximity** - Must be within 3 meters (~10 feet)
2. **Voice Biometric Authentication** - Your voice must match enrolled profile
3. **JARVIS Command Processing** - Natural language commands
4. **Automatic Lock/Unlock** - Based on Apple Watch distance

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow

```
User approaches Mac with Apple Watch
    ↓
Apple Watch detected (Bluetooth LE)
    ↓
User says: "Hey JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
    ↓
JARVIS checks:
    ✓ Apple Watch proximity (<3m)
    ✓ Watch is unlocked
    ✓ Voice biometrics match
    ✓ Anti-spoofing passed
    ↓
Mac unlocks → "Welcome back, John"
```

### Automatic Lock

```
User walks away from Mac
    ↓
Apple Watch distance > 10m
    ↓
System automatically locks
    ↓
"System locked. Have a good day."
```

## Supported Commands

### Unlock Commands
- "Hey JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
- "JARVIS, this is [name]"
- "JARVIS, authenticate me"
- "Open sesame, JARVIS"

### Lock Commands
- "JARVIS, lock my Mac"
- "JARVIS, activate security"
- "JARVIS, I'm leaving"

### Status Commands
- "JARVIS, what's the status?"
- "JARVIS, who's logged in?"
- "JARVIS, am I authenticated?"

### Management Commands
- "JARVIS, enroll user [name]"
- "JARVIS, create voice profile for [name]"

## Configuration

### Apple Watch Settings

```python
# config.py or environment variables
VOICE_UNLOCK_APPLE_WATCH=true        # Enable Apple Watch integration
VOICE_UNLOCK_AUTO_LOCK=true          # Auto-lock when watch out of range
VOICE_UNLOCK_UNLOCK_DISTANCE=3.0     # Meters (10 feet)
VOICE_UNLOCK_LOCK_DISTANCE=10.0      # Meters (33 feet)
```

### Security Requirements

```python
# Require unlocked Apple Watch
require_unlocked_watch: true

# Require both voice AND watch
require_watch: true

# Anti-spoofing level
anti_spoofing_level: high
```

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **AppleWatchProximityDetector** (`apple_watch_proximity.py`)
   - Bluetooth LE scanning for Apple Watch
   - Distance estimation from RSSI
   - Automatic pairing management
   - Lock/unlock callbacks

2. **JARVISCommandHandler** (`jarvis_command_handler.py`)
   - Natural language command parsing
   - Context-aware responses
   - Command validation

3. **VoiceUnlockSystem** (`voice_unlock_integration.py`)
   - Integrates all components
   - Handles authentication flow
   - Manages system state

### Apple Watch Detection

The system uses Bluetooth LE to detect Apple Watch proximity:

```python
# RSSI to distance mapping
RSSI_THRESHOLDS = {
    'immediate': -50,  # < 1 meter
    'near': -65,       # 1-3 meters  
    'far': -80,        # 3-10 meters
    'unknown': -100    # > 10 meters
}
```

### Memory Optimization

- Apple Watch detector is lazy-loaded
- Bluetooth scanning only when needed
- Minimal memory footprint (~10MB)
- Integrated with ML optimization

## Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Python 3.8+
- Apple Watch (Series 3 or later)
- Bluetooth enabled

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install bleak  # For Bluetooth LE
   # OR
   pip install pyobjc  # For CoreBluetooth (macOS native)
   ```

2. Pair your Apple Watch:
   ```bash
   jarvis-voice-unlock pair-watch
   ```

3. Enroll your voice:
   ```bash
   jarvis-voice-unlock enroll john
   ```

4. Test the system:
   ```bash
   jarvis-voice-unlock test
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Authentication

```python
# User approaches with Apple Watch
"Hey JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
→ JARVIS: "Apple Watch detected at 2.5 meters. Welcome back, John."
→ Mac unlocks
```

### Failed Authentication

```python
# Apple Watch not nearby
"JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
→ JARVIS: "Authentication failed. Apple Watch not detected nearby."
→ Mac remains locked
```

### Auto Lock

```python
# User walks away
[Apple Watch distance > 10m]
→ JARVIS: "System locked. Have a good day."
→ Mac locks automatically
```

## Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication

1. **Something You Have** - Apple Watch
2. **Something You Are** - Voice biometrics
3. **Something You Know** - Voice command

### Anti-Spoofing Protection

- Voice liveness detection
- Replay attack prevention
- Environmental consistency checks
- Ultrasonic markers (optional)

### Privacy

- Voice samples encrypted
- Local processing only
- No cloud dependencies
- Secure keychain storage

## Troubleshooting

### Apple Watch Not Detected

1. Check Bluetooth is enabled:
   ```bash
   system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType
   ```

2. Verify watch is paired:
   ```bash
   jarvis-voice-unlock status
   ```

3. Check distance (must be <3m)

### Voice Not Recognized

1. Re-enroll in quiet environment
2. Speak clearly and naturally
3. Use enrolled phrases

### Auto-Lock Not Working

1. Verify configuration:
   ```bash
   jarvis-voice-unlock configure
   ```

2. Check Apple Watch battery
3. Ensure Bluetooth connection stable

## Performance

### Typical Response Times

- Apple Watch detection: <100ms
- Voice processing: 100-200ms
- Total authentication: <300ms

### Resource Usage

- CPU: <5% idle, <25% during auth
- Memory: ~150MB total
- Battery: Minimal impact

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Distance Thresholds

```python
# Tighter security (1.5m unlock, 5m lock)
config.system.unlock_distance = 1.5
config.system.lock_distance = 5.0
```

### Voice-Only Mode

```python
# Disable Apple Watch requirement
system.authenticate_with_voice(require_watch=False)
```

### Multiple Watches

```python
# Pair additional watches
detector.pair_watch("watch_id_2")
```

## Integration with JARVIS

The voice unlock system integrates seamlessly with the main JARVIS assistant:

1. **Unified Voice Interface** - Same voice commands
2. **Shared ML Models** - Efficient resource usage
3. **Context Awareness** - JARVIS knows lock state
4. **Automation** - Trigger actions on unlock

Example workflow:
```
"JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
→ Mac unlocks
→ "Welcome back. You have 3 unread emails and 2 calendar reminders."
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **watchOS App** - Native Apple Watch app
2. **Touch ID Integration** - Additional factor
3. **Face ID Support** - For newer Macs
4. **Multiple Device Support** - iPhone proximity
5. **Geofencing** - Location-based security

## Contributing

When adding features:
1. Maintain Apple Watch compatibility
2. Test with various distances
3. Ensure low latency
