# JARVIS CPU Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

Applied multiple CPU optimization strategies to reduce JARVIS continuous learning from 97% CPU usage to target of 25%.

### Results

- **Initial CPU Usage**: 97% 
- **Current CPU Usage**: 75-79% (average)
- **Reduction Achieved**: ~20-22%
- **Target**: 25%
- **Status**: Partial success - significant improvement but target not reached

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Python-Only Optimizations âœ…
- Created `optimized_continuous_learning.py` with:
  - INT8 quantization simulation
  - CPU throttling mechanisms  
  - Batch size reduction
  - Thread limiting
  - Adaptive scheduling

### 2. Environment Variables âœ…
- Set aggressive CPU limits:
  - `DISABLE_CONTINUOUS_LEARNING=true`
  - `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`
  - `MKL_NUM_THREADS=1`
  - `LEARNING_CPU_LIMIT=20`
  - `CPU_LIMIT_PERCENT=25`

### 3. Vision System Patching âœ…
- Modified `vision_system_v2.py` to add CPU checks
- Disabled high-CPU continuous learning components
- Added throttling to vision processing

### 4. Process Management âœ…
- Installed `cpulimit` for external CPU control
- Applied `nice -n 19` for process priority reduction
- Created monitoring tools for verification

### 5. Rust Performance Layer ðŸš§
- Designed complete Rust-Python hybrid architecture
- Created Rust modules for:
  - INT8 quantized inference
  - Parallel vision processing  
  - Zero-copy memory management
- **Status**: Structure created but not built due to dependency issues

## Key Findings

1. **Memory Manager Issue**: Warning threshold incorrectly set at 0.8% causing excessive logging
2. **Circular Import**: Between `advanced_continuous_learning.py` and `integrate_robust_learning.py`
3. **CPU Bottleneck**: Main CPU usage from ML model loading and vision processing loops
4. **cpulimit Detection**: Tool installed but script couldn't detect it properly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Install and configure cpulimit properly:
   ```bash
   brew install cpulimit
   cpulimit -l 25 python main.py
   ```

2. Fix memory manager threshold in `memory/memory_manager.py`

3. Disable vision monitoring temporarily:
   ```bash
   export DISABLE_VISION_MONITORING=true
   ```

### Long-term Solutions
1. Complete Rust performance layer build
2. Implement proper model quantization (real INT8)
3. Move heavy ML operations to background workers
4. Use model caching to avoid repeated loading

## Files Created/Modified

- `/emergency_cpu_fix.py` - Initial throttling solution
- `/optimized_continuous_learning.py` - Python INT8 optimization
- `/apply_final_cpu_fix.py` - Aggressive CPU limiting script
- `/monitor_cpu.py` - CPU usage monitoring tool
- `/rust_performance/` - Complete Rust performance layer structure
- `/.env` - Environment variables for CPU limiting

## Next Steps

1. Fix cpulimit path detection and rerun with proper CPU limiting
2. Build Rust performance extensions when dependencies are resolved
3. Profile code to identify remaining CPU hotspots
4. Consider using lighter ML models for continuous learning

The 20-22% reduction achieved is significant but falls short of the 72% reduction target. External CPU limiting tools and further architectural changes will be needed to reach 25% CPU usage.
