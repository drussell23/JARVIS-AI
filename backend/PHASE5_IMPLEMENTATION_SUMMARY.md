# JARVIS Vision System v2.0 - Phase 5 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 5 implements Autonomous Capability Discovery, enabling JARVIS to automatically generate, verify, and deploy new capabilities based on failed requests. This creates a truly self-improving system that learns from its limitations.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Capability Generator (`capability_generator.py`)

## Usage Example

```python
from vision.vision_system_v2 import get_vision_system_v2

# Initialize system with Phase 5
system = get_vision_system_v2()

# Process a command that doesn't have a handler
response = await system.process_command(
    "analyze the green circles on the toolbar",
    context={'user': 'john_doe'}
)

# If the command fails, Phase 5 automatically:
# 1. Analyzes the failure
# 2. Generates a new capability if pattern detected
# 3. Synthesizes safe code
# 4. Verifies safety
# 5. Benchmarks performance
# 6. Creates gradual rollout
# 7. Deploys to canary users

# Check autonomous capabilities status
status = system.get_autonomous_capabilities_status()
print(f"Capabilities generated: {status['generation_stats']['total_generated']}")
print(f"Active rollouts: {status['rollout_status']['active']}")
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Self-Healing**: System automatically creates missing capabilities
2. **Safety-First**: Multiple layers of verification prevent unsafe code
3. **Zero-Downtime**: Gradual rollout ensures stability
4. **Performance-Aware**: Benchmarking prevents slow capabilities
5. **User-Transparent**: Capability generation happens in background

```bash
python test_vision_v2_phase5.py
```

For a quick functionality check:
```bash
python test_phase5_simple.py
```

## Technical Details

### Capability Generation Process
```
Failed Request → Failure Analysis → Pattern Detection → Code Generation
                                                      ↓
Deployment ← Rollout Creation ← Verification ← Safety Synthesis
```

### Safety Verification Layers
1. **Static Analysis**: AST parsing, forbidden patterns
2. **Sandbox Testing**: Resource-limited execution
3. **Behavior Analysis**: Side effect detection
4. **Performance Validation**: Latency and throughput checks

### Rollout Decision Matrix
| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Success Rate | <95% | Pause/Rollback |
| Error Rate | >5% | Pause/Rollback |
| P99 Latency | >100ms | Pause/Review |
| User Feedback | <80% positive | Pause/Review |

## Security Considerations

- **Code Injection Prevention**: AST-based validation prevents injection
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Hard limits on CPU, memory, and time
- **Credential Protection**: Automatic sanitization of secrets
- **Network Isolation**: Sandboxed execution with no network access
- **Privilege Escalation**: Forbidden operations blocked at multiple levels

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Code Generation**: Use LLMs for more sophisticated code
2. **Cross-User Learning**: Share verified capabilities across deployments
3. **Capability Evolution**: Improve existing capabilities based on usage
4. **Visual Programming**: Generate capabilities from visual demonstrations
5. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs of capability safety

## Conclusion

Phase 5 completes the JARVIS Vision System v2.0 by adding true autonomous learning capabilities. The system can now:
- **Discover** its own limitations through failure analysis
- **Generate** new capabilities to address those limitations  
- **Verify** safety through comprehensive multi-level checks
- **Deploy** gradually with automatic rollback on issues
- **Learn** from deployment to improve future generations

This creates a continuously improving AI system that becomes more capable over time while maintaining strict safety guarantees. The implementation provides a robust foundation for building truly autonomous AI assistants that can adapt to new challenges without human intervention.
