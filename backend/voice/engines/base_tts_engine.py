Base TTS Engine Interface

This module defines the common interface and data structures for all Text-to-Speech engines
in the voice processing system. It provides abstract base classes and configuration objects
that ensure consistent behavior across different TTS implementations.

The module includes:
- TTSEngine enum for supported engine types
- TTSConfig dataclass for engine configuration
- TTSResult dataclass for synthesis results
- BaseTTSEngine abstract base class for implementation

Example:
    >>> from backend.voice.engines.base_tts_engine import TTSEngine, TTSConfig
    >>> config = TTSConfig(name="my_tts", engine=TTSEngine.GTTS, language="en")
    >>> # Use config with concrete TTS engine implementation
