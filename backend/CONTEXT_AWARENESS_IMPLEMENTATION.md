# JARVIS Context Awareness Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a context awareness system for JARVIS that handles the specific scenario you requested: when the screen is locked and you give a command that requires screen access, JARVIS will:

1. Detect that the screen is locked
2. Inform you: "Your screen is locked. I'll unlock it now by typing in the password."
3. Unlock the screen using the stored password
4. Execute your original command
5. Confirm what was done

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **Simple Context Handler** (`api/simple_context_handler.py`)
   - Lightweight context awareness wrapper
   - Detects commands that require screen access
   - Handles the unlock flow when needed
   - Maintains the original response while adding context info

2. **Direct Unlock Handler** (`api/direct_unlock_handler.py`)
   - Direct WebSocket communication with voice unlock daemon
   - Fallback to system API for screen lock detection
   - Simplified unlock process

3. **Main.py Integration**
   - Added simple context awareness flag (`USE_SIMPLE_CONTEXT = True`)
   - Wraps the UnifiedCommandProcessor with context awareness
   - Can be disabled by setting the flag to False

### Commands That Require Screen Access

The system recognizes these patterns as requiring an unlocked screen:
- Browser operations: 'open safari', 'open chrome', 'search for', 'google'
- Application operations: 'open', 'launch', 'start', 'run'
- File operations: 'create', 'edit', 'save', 'close'
- UI operations: 'show me', 'display', 'navigate to'

### Testing

1. **Basic Test**: `python test_screen_context.py`
2. **Interactive Demo**: `python demo_context_awareness.py`

## Current Status

✅ **Working:**
- Screen lock/unlock functionality works perfectly (as you mentioned)
- Basic context detection is implemented
- Simple context handler is integrated

⚠️ **Limitations:**
- The full context_intelligence system has many dependencies that were causing import errors
- I've temporarily disabled the complex context awareness in favor of a simple, working solution
- The simple handler focuses specifically on your use case

## Usage Example

When you say: "Hey JARVIS, open Safari and search for dogs" while the screen is locked:

1. JARVIS detects the locked screen
2. Responds: "Your screen is locked. I'll unlock it now by typing in the password."
3. Unlocks the screen
4. Opens Safari and performs the search
5. Confirms: "I've unlocked your screen. Now opening Safari and searching for dogs."

## Future Improvements

If you want to expand the context awareness system:
1. Complete the context_intelligence module implementation
2. Add more context detectors (app state, network state, etc.)
3. Implement the workflow executor for complex multi-step tasks
4. Add learning capabilities to improve context detection

## Troubleshooting

If context awareness isn't working:
1. Check that the Voice Unlock daemon is running (`ps aux | grep websocket_server`)
2. Ensure screen lock is enabled in System Preferences
3. Verify the backend is running on port 8000
4. Check the logs: `tail -f jarvis_backend_context.log`

## Configuration

To disable context awareness (if needed):
```python
# In main.py, change:
USE_SIMPLE_CONTEXT = False
```

This will revert to the standard command processing without context awareness.
