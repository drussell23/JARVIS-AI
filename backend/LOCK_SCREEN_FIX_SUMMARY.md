# Lock Screen Command Fix Summary

## Problem
When users said "lock my screen", JARVIS was incorrectly interpreting this as a vision monitoring command and responding with "I cannot start monitoring right now, Sir. Monitoring is already active" instead of actually locking the screen.

## Root Cause
The `unified_command_processor.py` was routing commands containing the word "screen" to the vision handler because of the vision score calculation, which was happening before the check for lock/unlock commands.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Command Classification Fix** (`unified_command_processor.py`)
- Added explicit check for lock/unlock screen commands BEFORE vision detection
- Commands containing both "lock/unlock" and "screen" now get classified as SYSTEM commands with high confidence (0.95)

```python
# Check for lock/unlock screen commands BEFORE vision detection
if any(word in ['lock', 'unlock'] for word in words) and 'screen' in words:
    logger.info(f"[CLASSIFY] Screen lock/unlock command detected: '{command_text}'")
    return CommandType.SYSTEM, 0.95
```

### 2. **System Command Execution** (`unified_command_processor.py`)
- Modified `_execute_system_command` to properly route lock/unlock commands
- Integrates with existing `simple_unlock_handler` which uses the Voice Unlock daemon
- Provides fallback to `macos_controller` if daemon is not available

### 3. **macOS Controller Integration** (`macos_controller.py`)
- Added `lock_screen()` and `unlock_screen()` methods
- Integrates with Voice Unlock daemon via WebSocket
- Provides multiple fallback methods:
  - CGSession for locking
  - AppleScript keyboard shortcut
  - pmset display sleep

### 4. **Daemon Integration**
The fix properly integrates with the existing infrastructure:

- **Voice Unlock Daemon**: Primary method for lock/unlock operations
- **WebSocket Communication**: Uses `ws://localhost:8765/voice-unlock`
- **Objective-C Integration**: Leverages existing `JARVISScreenUnlockManager`
- **Security**: Maintains security by using the established authentication system

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
cd backend
python test_lock_screen_fix.py
```

This will test:
1. Lock screen command routing
2. Unlock screen command routing
3. Vision monitoring still works correctly
4. Daemon integration

## Command Flow

```
User: "lock my screen"
    ↓
UnifiedCommandProcessor.classify_command()
    ↓
Detects "lock" + "screen" → CommandType.SYSTEM
    ↓
_execute_system_command()
    ↓
Tries simple_unlock_handler.handle_unlock_command()
    ↓
Connects to Voice Unlock daemon via WebSocket
    ↓
Sends: {"type": "command", "command": "lock_screen"}
    ↓
Daemon executes CGSession -suspend
    ↓
Screen locks successfully
```

## Fallback Chain

If the Voice Unlock daemon is not running:

1. **CGSession**: `/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend`
2. **AppleScript**: `keystroke "q" using {command down, control down}`
3. **pmset**: `pmset displaysleepnow`

## Files Modified

1. `backend/api/unified_command_processor.py`
   - Added lock/unlock detection before vision scoring
   - Modified system command execution to use proper handlers

2. `backend/system_control/macos_controller.py`
   - Added lock_screen() and unlock_screen() methods
   - Added handle_command() for system command routing
   - Integrated with Voice Unlock daemon

## Verification

After the fix:
- ✅ "lock my screen" → Screen locks
- ✅ "unlock my screen" → Screen unlocks (with authentication)
- ✅ "start monitoring" → Vision monitoring (still works)
- ✅ Daemon integration maintained
- ✅ Security preserved (unlock requires authentication)
