# JARVIS Voice Unlock - Quick Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Run the install script
./install_voice_unlock_deps.sh

# OR manually install core packages
pip install fastapi anthropic scikit-learn librosa sounddevice bleak
```

### 2. Test Configuration (Auto-optimizes for your RAM)

```bash
# Check configuration and optimizations
python backend/voice_unlock/test_config.py
```

The system automatically detects your RAM and applies appropriate optimizations:
- **16GB**: Quantization ON, 400MB limit, aggressive unloading
- **32GB**: Quantization OFF, 800MB limit, normal unloading  
- **64GB+**: Full capabilities, no restrictions

### 3. Test Voice Unlock

```bash
# Check if everything is working
python backend/voice_unlock/jarvis_integration.py
```

### 4. Enroll Your Voice

```bash
# Install the voice unlock command
cd backend/voice_unlock
./install.sh

# Enroll your voice (3 samples)
jarvis-voice-unlock enroll john
```

### 5. Test Authentication

```bash
# Test with Apple Watch nearby
jarvis-voice-unlock test

# Test voice commands
Say: "Hey JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
Say: "JARVIS, this is John"
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Missing Dependencies Error

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pip install -r backend/voice_unlock/requirements.txt
```

### ProcessCleanupManager Error

âœ… Already fixed! The config attribute has been added.

### High Memory Usage

âœ… Already optimized! The system is configured for 16GB RAM with:
- Max 400MB for voice unlock
- Aggressive model unloading
- Quantization enabled
- Lazy loading everywhere

### Apple Watch Not Detected

1. Check Bluetooth is enabled:
   ```bash
   system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType
   ```

2. Make sure Apple Watch is:
   - Paired with your Mac
   - Unlocked
   - Within 3 meters (10 feet)

### Microphone Permission

Grant microphone access when prompted, or manually in:
System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ Privacy â†’ Microphone â†’ Terminal

## ðŸ“Š Memory Usage

With the optimizations applied:

| Component | Memory | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Voice Unlock | 400MB | Authentication system |
| ML Models | 200MB | Voice recognition models |
| Cache | 150MB | Performance optimization |
| Audio Buffer | 50MB | Real-time processing |
| **Total** | **800MB** | Complete system |

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration with JARVIS

The voice unlock system is now integrated with JARVIS startup:

1. **Automatic Start**: Voice unlock starts with JARVIS
2. **Background Operation**: Runs without blocking
3. **Apple Watch**: Proximity detection active
4. **Commands**: "Hey JARVIS, unlock my Mac"

## âœ… What's Working Now

1. **ProcessCleanupManager** - Config attribute added âœ“
2. **Dependencies** - Install script created âœ“
3. **Memory Optimization** - 16GB config applied âœ“
4. **Apple Watch Integration** - Proximity detection âœ“
5. **JARVIS Integration** - Startup hooks added âœ“

## ðŸš¦ Next Steps

1. Run `./install_voice_unlock_deps.sh`
2. Restart JARVIS
3. Enroll your voice
4. Enjoy hands-free Mac unlocking!
