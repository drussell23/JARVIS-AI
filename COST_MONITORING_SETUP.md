## Overview

JARVIS Hybrid Cloud Intelligence now includes comprehensive cost monitoring to track GCP Spot VM usage, prevent cost leaks from orphaned VMs, and provide real-time visibility into cloud spending.

### Why Cost Monitoring?

- **Spot VMs are cheap** ($0.029/hour) but can add up if left running
- **3-hour max runtime** protects against runaway costs, but cleanup failures need detection
- **Budget visibility** ensures you stay within the projected $11-15/month target
- **Immediate alerts** notify you if costs spike unexpectedly

### Key Metrics Tracked

- VM creation count and runtime hours
- Estimated costs vs actual GCP billing
- Orphaned VMs (cleanup failures)
- Local vs GCP routing ratios
- Average VM lifetime per session
- Cost savings vs regular (non-Spot) VMs

---

- Initialize cost tracking database
- Guide you through GCP budget alert setup

### 2. Configure Email Alerts (Optional)

Edit `~/.jarvis/.env`:
```bash
JARVIS_ALERT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
```

### 3. Set Up GCP Budget Alerts (Manual - See Below)

### 4. Test Cost Tracking

```bash
# Start JARVIS backend
python backend/main.py

# Check cost summary (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/cost

# Check orphaned VMs
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/orphaned-vms

# Check routing metrics
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/metrics/routing
```

## GCP Budget Alerts Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Budget alerts must be configured manually via GCP Console (gcloud CLI doesn't support budget creation).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Access GCP Billing Console

1. Visit: [https://console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2. Select your billing account
3. Click **"Budgets & alerts"** in the left sidebar

#### 2. Create Budget Alert - $20/month

1. Click **"CREATE BUDGET"**

2. **Scope:**
   - Projects: Select `jarvis-473803` (or your project ID)
   - Products: All products
   - Services: All services

3. **Amount:**
   - Budget type: **Specified amount**
   - Target amount: **$20.00** per month

4. **Actions:**
   - Threshold rules:
     - 50% ($10.00)
     - 90% ($18.00)
     - 100% ($20.00)
   - Manage notifications:
     - Email: **Your email address**
     - Add secondary email if desired

5. **Finish:**
   - Budget name: `jarvis-hybrid-cloud-budget-20`
   - Click **"FINISH"**

#### 3. Create Additional Budget Alerts

Repeat for higher thresholds:

- **$50/month Budget:**
  - Name: `jarvis-hybrid-cloud-budget-50`
  - Thresholds: 50%, 90%, 100%

- **$100/month Budget:**
  - Name: `jarvis-hybrid-cloud-budget-100`
  - Thresholds: 50%, 90%, 100%

### Expected Costs

Based on Spot VM usage (e2-highmem-4 @ $0.029/hour):

| Usage Pattern | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|-------------|
| 1 hour/day | ~$0.87/month |
| 2 hours/day | ~$1.74/month |
| 4 hours/day | ~$3.48/month |
| 8 hours/day | ~$6.96/month |
| 12 hours/day | ~$10.44/month |
| 16 hours/day | ~$13.92/month |

**Target:** $11-15/month (10-13 hours/day of Spot VM usage)

### Alert Thresholds Explained

- **$20/month:** Early warning if usage exceeds budget
- **$50/month:** Secondary alert for unexpected spike
- **$100/month:** Critical alert - investigate immediately

## Orphaned VM Monitoring

### What are Orphaned VMs?

VMs created by JARVIS but not properly deleted on shutdown due to:
- JARVIS crash before cleanup runs
- Network issues preventing deletion
- GCP API errors
- Manual JARVIS termination (SIGKILL)

### Detection & Cleanup

#### Automatic Cleanup (Cron Job)

Runs every 6 hours via cron:
```bash
0 */6 * * * ~/Documents/repos/JARVIS-AI-Agent/scripts/cleanup_orphaned_vms.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Lists all `jarvis-auto-*` VMs in GCP
2. Checks age of each VM (creation timestamp)
3. Deletes VMs older than 6 hours
4. Records orphaned VMs in cost database
5. Sends notifications (if configured)
6. Logs all actions

#### Manual Cleanup

```bash
# Run cleanup script manually
bash scripts/cleanup_orphaned_vms.sh

# View cleanup logs
tail -f ~/.jarvis/logs/vm_cleanup_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

#### Check for Orphaned VMs

```bash
# Via API
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/orphaned-vms

# Via gcloud
gcloud compute instances list \
  --project=jarvis-473803 \
  --filter="name~'jarvis-auto-.*'"
```

---

## Automated Cleanup

### Cron Job Configuration

**Schedule:** Every 6 hours
**Command:** `cleanup_orphaned_vms.sh`
**Log:** `~/.jarvis/logs/cron_cleanup.log`

### Cleanup Script Features

- **Age threshold:** 6 hours (configurable via `MAX_AGE_HOURS`)
- **Safety margin:** Won't delete VMs younger than threshold
- **Cost tracking:** Records all orphaned VMs with runtime and cost
- **Notifications:**
  - macOS: Desktop notification via `osascript`
  - Email: Alert if `JARVIS_ALERT_EMAIL` configured
- **Comprehensive logging:** All actions logged with timestamps

### Notification Setup

#### macOS Desktop Notifications

Already enabled - notifications appear automatically when orphaned VMs are found.

#### Email Alerts

1. Configure email in `~/.jarvis/.env`:
   ```bash
   JARVIS_ALERT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   ```

2. Ensure `mail` command is available:
   ```bash
   # Test
   echo "Test" | mail -s "Test" your-email@example.com
   ```

3. Configure macOS mail (if not already):
   - System Preferences ‚Üí Internet Accounts ‚Üí Add email account

---

## Testing

### 1. Test Cost Tracking Initialization

```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
python main.py

# Should see in logs:
# "‚úÖ Hybrid Cloud Cost Monitoring API mounted at /hybrid"
# "üí∞ Cost tracking system initialized"
```

### 2. Test Cost Endpoints

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/health

# Initialize database (idempotent)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/hybrid/initialize

# Get cost summary
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/cost

# Get status
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/status
```

Expected responses:
- `200 OK` for all endpoints
- JSON data with cost metrics
- No errors in backend logs

### 3. Test Orphaned VM Cleanup

```bash
# Run cleanup script
bash scripts/cleanup_orphaned_vms.sh

# Check logs
cat ~/.jarvis/logs/vm_cleanup_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

Expected output:
```
[2025-10-25 12:00:00] üîç Checking for orphaned JARVIS VMs...
[2025-10-25 12:00:01] ‚úÖ No orphaned VMs found
```

### 4. Test End-to-End Cost Tracking

```bash
# 1. Start JARVIS
python start_system.py

# 2. Trigger GCP shift (simulate high RAM)
# Wait for VM creation logs:
# "üìù Tracking GCP instance for cleanup: jarvis-auto-XXXXX"
# "üí∞ Cost tracking: VM creation recorded"

# 3. Check cost API
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/cost?period=day

# 4. Stop JARVIS (graceful shutdown)
# Wait for VM deletion logs:
# "‚úÖ Deleted GCP instance: jarvis-auto-XXXXX"
# "üí∞ Cost tracking: VM deletion recorded"

# 5. Verify cost summary
curl http://localhost:8010/hybrid/cost?period=day
# Should show 1 VM created, with runtime and cost
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cost Tracking Database Not Initializing

**Symptom:** API returns 500 errors or "database not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manually initialize database
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/hybrid/initialize

# Or run Python directly
python3 - <<'EOF'
import asyncio
from backend.core.cost_tracker import initialize_cost_tracking

async def main():
    await initialize_cost_tracking()

asyncio.run(main())
EOF
```

### Cron Job Not Running

**Check cron jobs:**
```bash
crontab -l
```

**View cron logs:**
```bash
tail -f ~/.jarvis/logs/cron_cleanup.log
```

**Manual cron setup:**
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add line:
0 */6 * * * /full/path/to/cleanup_orphaned_vms.sh >> ~/.jarvis/logs/cron_cleanup.log 2>&1
```

### Cleanup Script Permission Denied

```bash
chmod +x scripts/cleanup_orphaned_vms.sh
```

### GCP Budget Alerts Not Showing

1. Verify billing account is active
2. Check budget configuration in GCP Console
3. Verify email is correct in budget settings
4. Check spam folder for GCP emails

### Cost Data Seems Wrong

**Check database:**
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.jarvis/learning/cost_tracking.db "SELECT * FROM vm_sessions;"
```

**Verify GCP billing:**
- Compare with actual GCP billing report
- Cost tracker shows *estimates* based on Spot VM rates
- Actual billing may vary slightly

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended

1. **Run setup script:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup_cost_monitoring.sh
   ```

2. **Configure GCP budget alerts** (follow guide above)

3. **Set email for alerts** in `~/.jarvis/.env`

4. **Test end-to-end:**
   - Create VM via RAM pressure
   - Verify cost tracking records it
   - Stop JARVIS and verify deletion recorded
   - Check cost summary via API

5. **Monitor regularly:**
   - Check `/hybrid/status` endpoint daily
   - Review cleanup logs weekly
   - Compare cost tracker estimates with GCP billing monthly

### Future Enhancements (Priority 3+)

- Frontend dashboard for cost visualization
- Real-time cost graphs and charts
- Cost projection based on usage patterns
- Automated cost optimization recommendations
- Integration with GCP Cost Management API (real billing data)
- Slack/Discord notifications for cost alerts
- Cost breakdown by component type
- Historical cost trend analysis

---

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Monitor average VM lifetime:**
   - Target: < 2.5 hours per session
   - If consistently > 2.5 hours, investigate why VMs run so long

2. **Check GCP routing ratio:**
   - Ideal: 20-30% of heavy workloads to GCP
   - Too low: Not utilizing hybrid cloud enough
   - Too high: May indicate local RAM issues

3. **Watch for orphaned VMs:**
   - Should be ZERO in normal operation
   - If orphaned VMs appear regularly, investigate cleanup reliability

4. **Compare Spot vs Regular pricing:**
   - Cost tracker shows savings percentage
   - Should be ~75-80% savings vs regular VMs
   - Validates Spot VM cost efficiency

5. **Set conservative budgets:**
   - Start with $20/month budget
   - Adjust based on actual usage patterns
   - Better to get early warnings than surprises
