# 🎯 Proximity-Aware Display Connection - COMPLETE GUIDE

## ❓ **Your Question Answered**

> "So basically if when I run JARVIS and JARVIS can detect that my MacBook is in close distance to the Sony TV (if the TV is on), JARVIS would ask me if I want to connect to it via screen sharing and basically I should reply 'yes' to connect or 'no' not to connect, correct?"

### **Answer: YES - With Important Details** ✅

**The Flow:**
```
1. You walk near Sony TV with Apple Watch
2. JARVIS detects your proximity (2.5m away)
3. JARVIS checks if Sony TV is available (on and connected)
4. JARVIS: "Sir, I see you're near the Sony Living Room TV. Would you like to connect?"
5. YOU: "Yes" or "No"
6. If YES → Display extends to TV automatically (background)
7. If NO → JARVIS won't ask again for 5 minutes
```

## ⚠️ **Critical Clarifications**

### **1. Apple Watch Requirement**

**❓ Do you need Apple Watch?**

**YES** - Here's why:

```
❌ WRONG ASSUMPTION:
"MacBook detects proximity to Sony TV"

✅ ACTUAL SYSTEM:
"Apple Watch on your wrist → Bluetooth signal → MacBook detects YOU"
```

**Why Can't MacBook Detect Proximity Alone?**
- MacBook Bluetooth = fixed at MacBook's location (0m always)
- Can't detect "I'm moving near the TV"
- Needs a **mobile Bluetooth device** (Watch/iPhone) to track YOUR movement

**What You Need:**
- ✅ Apple Watch (on your wrist) **OR**
- ✅ iPhone (in your pocket) **OR**
- ✅ AirPods (in your ears)

**One of these must be with you as you move around**

### **2. Sony TV Must Be Pre-Connected**

**JARVIS cannot turn on your TV or establish initial connection.**

**Initial Setup Required:**
```bash
# Option A: Physical HDMI Cable
1. Connect Sony TV to MacBook via HDMI cable
2. Turn on TV
3. TV appears in System Preferences → Displays

# Option B: AirPlay (Wireless)
1. Ensure Sony TV supports AirPlay
2. Connect via macOS AirPlay menu
3. TV appears as available display
```

**Then register in JARVIS:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "display_id": 23,
    "location_name": "Sony Living Room TV",
    "zone": "living_room",
    "min_distance": 2.0,
    "max_distance": 8.0,
    "auto_connect_enabled": true,
    "connection_priority": 0.8,
    "tags": ["tv", "sony", "living_room"]
  }'
```

### **3. "Screen Sharing" vs "Display Mirroring/Extending"**

**What You Likely Mean:**
- **Display Mirroring/Extending** - Your MacBook screen shows on Sony TV
- This is what's implemented ✅

**What "Screen Sharing" Actually Means:**
- Remote desktop to another Mac over network
- Not needed for your use case

**What JARVIS Does:**
- **Mirror Mode:** Sony TV shows same content as MacBook
- **Extend Mode:** Sony TV becomes second screen (recommended)

## 🔧 **Complete Workflow (With Voice Integration)**

### **Full Scenario: Walking to Living Room**

```
PREREQUISITES:
✅ Sony TV is on and connected (HDMI or AirPlay)
✅ Apple Watch is on your wrist
✅ Sony TV is registered in JARVIS config
✅ JARVIS backend is running

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: You walk into living room
  → Apple Watch Bluetooth signal detected
  → RSSI: -55 dBm
  → Calculated distance: 2.5 meters from MacBook

STEP 2: JARVIS correlates your location with TV
  → MacBook is in living room
  → Sony TV is configured at living room location
  → Expected TV proximity range: 2-8 meters
  → Your distance: 2.5m ✅ (within range)

STEP 3: JARVIS checks if Sony TV is available
  → Queries macOS display list
  → Sony TV (display ID: 23) found ✅
  → Status: Online and ready

STEP 4: JARVIS makes connection decision
  → Distance: 2.5m (NEAR zone)
  → Confidence: 0.75
  → Action: PROMPT_USER

STEP 5: JARVIS prompts you via voice
  JARVIS: "Sir, I see you're near the Sony Living Room TV, 
           about 2.5 meters away. Shall I connect?"

STEP 6: You respond via voice
  YOU: "Yes"

STEP 7: JARVIS connects (backend automation)
  → AppleScript opens System Preferences (background)
  → Unchecks "Mirror Displays" (extend mode)
  → Display extends to Sony TV
  → Execution time: ~2-3 seconds

STEP 8: JARVIS confirms
  JARVIS: "Connecting to Sony Living Room TV... Done, sir."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

ALTERNATIVE: You say "No"
  YOU: "No"
  
  JARVIS: "Understood, sir. I won't ask again for a few minutes."
  
  → User override registered (5 min cooldown)
  → JARVIS won't prompt again until cooldown expires
```

## 🎯 **How Each Feature Works**

### **1. Apple Watch Proximity Detection** 📡

**Your Apple Watch broadcasts Bluetooth LE signal:**
```
Apple Watch → Bluetooth signal → MacBook receives

Signal strength (RSSI):
  -40 dBm = Very close (< 1m)
  -55 dBm = Near (2-3m)
  -70 dBm = Same room (5-8m)
  -85 dBm = Far (10-15m)

Distance calculation:
  d = 10^((RSSI_0 - RSSI) / (10 * n))
  
  RSSI_0 = -59 dBm (reference at 1 meter)
  n = 2.5 (path loss exponent)
  
  Example: RSSI -55 dBm → 2.3 meters
```

**Accuracy:** ±2-3 meters (typical Bluetooth limitation)

### **2. Display Location Correlation** 📍

**You configure TV locations in advance:**
```json
{
  "display_id": 23,
  "location_name": "Sony Living Room TV",
  "expected_proximity_range": [2.0, 8.0]
}
```

**JARVIS correlates:**
```
Your distance from MacBook: 2.5m
Sony TV expected range: 2.0-8.0m
Match: ✅ You're in range of Sony TV
Proximity score: 0.85 (high)
```

### **3. TV On/Off Detection** 🔌

**How JARVIS knows if TV is on:**
```
JARVIS queries: macOS display list (CoreGraphics API)

If TV is ON and connected:
  → Display ID 23 appears in list ✅
  → Status: "available"
  → JARVIS can prompt you

If TV is OFF or unplugged:
  → Display ID 23 NOT in list ❌
  → Status: "offline"
  → JARVIS: "The Sony TV appears to be offline. Please ensure it's powered on."
```

**Limitation:** 
- Can't detect if TV is on but not connected (no cable/AirPlay)
- Can't turn on TV remotely (requires HDMI-CEC or smart features)

### **4. Voice Prompt & Response** 🎤

**Prompt Generation:**
```python
# When proximity detected and TV available
JARVIS: "Sir, I see you're near the Sony Living Room TV. Would you like to connect?"

# State changes to: WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE
# Timeout: 30 seconds
```

**Voice Command Detection:**
```python
Affirmative (connects):
  - "yes", "yeah", "yep", "sure", "connect", "ok", "okay", "please"

Negative (skips):
  - "no", "nope", "don't", "skip", "cancel", "not now"

Unclear:
  JARVIS: "Sir, I didn't quite catch that. Please say 'yes' or 'no'."
```

**Auto-Timeout:**
```python
If no response after 30 seconds:
  → State changes to: TIMEOUT
  → Prompt cleared
  → No action taken
```

  "Would you like to connect?"
```

### **TV Availability Detection:**

```
JARVIS checks: Is Sony TV in macOS display list?

If TV is ON and connected (HDMI/AirPlay):
  → macOS sees display ID 23 ✅
  → JARVIS: "TV is available"
  → Can prompt for connection

If TV is OFF or unplugged:
  → macOS does NOT see display ID 23 ❌
  → JARVIS: "Sony TV appears to be offline"
  → Won't prompt for connection
```

### **Connection Execution:**

```
AppleScript (runs in background - no UI):

tell application "System Preferences"
    reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab"
    activate
end tell

tell application "System Events"
    tell process "System Preferences"
        -- Uncheck "Mirror Displays" for extend mode
        click checkbox "Mirror Displays"
    end tell
end tell

Result: Display extends to Sony TV (~2-3 seconds)
```
