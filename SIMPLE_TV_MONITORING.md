# 📺 Simple Living Room TV Monitoring

## Overview

This is the **SIMPLE** solution for proximity-aware display connection - no Apple Watch, no Bluetooth, no complicated proximity detection needed!

### What It Does

1. **Monitors** for "Living Room TV" availability
2. **Detects** when the TV appears in Screen Mirroring menu
3. **Prompts** you: "Sir, would you like to extend to Living Room TV?"
4. **Connects** when you say "yes"

That's it. Simple, clean, effective.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the TV Monitor

```bash
python3 start_tv_monitoring.py
```

You'll see:
```
======================================================================
🖥️  JARVIS Living Room TV Monitor
======================================================================

📺 Monitoring for: Living Room TV
⏰ Check interval: Every 10 seconds

When your TV becomes available, JARVIS will prompt you to connect.
Press Ctrl+C to stop monitoring.

======================================================================
```

### 2. Turn On Your TV

When your Living Room TV turns on and connects to WiFi, the monitor will detect it and log:

```
[TV MONITOR] Living Room TV is now available!
[TV MONITOR] Generated prompt: Sir, I see your Living Room TV is now available. Would you like to extend your display to it?
```

### 3. Say Yes or No

- **Say "Yes"**: JARVIS connects to the TV
- **Say "No"**: JARVIS won't ask again for 60 minutes

## How It Works

### The Simple Approach

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Living Room TV │ ─── WiFi ───┐
└─────────────────┘              │
                                 ▼
                          ┌──────────────┐
                          │   MacBook    │
                          │  (monitors)  │
                          └──────────────┘
                                 │
                                 ▼
                          ┌──────────────┐
                          │    JARVIS    │
                          │   prompts    │
                          └──────────────┘
                                 │
                                 ▼
                     "Sir, extend to Living Room TV?"
```

### What We DON'T Use ❌

- ❌ Apple Watch proximity detection
- ❌ Bluetooth RSSI calculations
- ❌ Kalman filtering
- ❌ Physical location mapping
- ❌ Proximity zones
- ❌ 431 lines of overcomplicated code

### What We DO Use ✅

- ✅ macOS Screen Mirroring menu monitoring
- ✅ Simple availability detection
- ✅ Voice prompts
- ✅ ~200 lines of clean, simple code

## Configuration

### Change TV Name

Edit `start_tv_monitoring.py`:

```python
monitor = get_tv_monitor("Living Room TV")  # Change this
```

### Change Check Interval

Edit `backend/display/simple_tv_monitor.py`:

```python
def __init__(self, tv_name: str = "Living Room TV", check_interval: float = 10.0):
    # Change check_interval to 5.0 for faster checks
```

### Customize Prompts

Edit the prompt in `_generate_prompt()`:

```python
async def _generate_prompt(self):
    prompt = f"Sir, I see your {self.tv_name} is now available. Would you like to extend your display to it?"
    # Customize this message
```

## Integration with JARVIS

### Automatic Startup

To start TV monitoring automatically with JARVIS, add to `backend/main.py`:

```python
# In startup event
from display.simple_tv_monitor import get_tv_monitor

monitor = get_tv_monitor("Living Room TV")
await monitor.start()

logger.info("✅ Living Room TV monitoring started")
```

### Voice Command Integration

The monitor integrates with JARVIS voice commands:

```python
# When user says "yes" to prompt
result = await monitor.connect_to_tv(mode="extend")

# When user says "mirror instead"
result = await monitor.connect_to_tv(mode="mirror")
```

## Troubleshooting

### TV Not Detected

**Problem**: Monitor doesn't detect your TV

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ **Check TV is on** - Turn on your TV
2. ✅ **Check WiFi** - Ensure TV is on same WiFi as MacBook
3. ✅ **Check Screen Mirroring** - Manually click Screen Mirroring icon in menu bar
4. ✅ **Check TV name** - Ensure the name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Manual Test

Test if your TV is visible:

```bash
# Check Screen Mirroring manually
1. Click Screen Mirroring icon in menu bar (top right)
2. Look for "Living Room TV" in the menu
3. If you see it, the script will detect it too!
```

### Logs

Check logs for detailed information:

```bash
# The monitor logs everything
[TV MONITOR] Initialized for: Living Room TV
[TV MONITOR] Started monitoring for Living Room TV
[TV MONITOR] Found 1 external displays
[TV MONITOR] Living Room TV is now available!
```

## Removing Old Proximity Code

Since we're using this simple approach, you can safely remove:

### Files to Remove

```bash
# Remove entire proximity detection system
rm -rf backend/voice_unlock/proximity_voice_auth/
rm backend/voice_unlock/apple_watch_proximity.py
rm -rf backend/proximity/

# Remove related documentation
rm backend/voice_unlock/README_APPLE_WATCH.md
```

### Keep These Files

```bash
# Keep the simple monitoring system
backend/display/simple_tv_monitor.py          ✅
backend/display/display_monitor_service.py    ✅
backend/api/display_monitor_api.py            ✅
start_tv_monitoring.py                        ✅
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Simplicity**
- No complex Bluetooth scanning
- No RSSI calculations
- No Kalman filtering
- Just simple availability checking

### 2. **Reliability**
- Uses native macOS APIs
- Works with any AirPlay-capable display
- No external dependencies

### 3. **Maintainability**
- ~200 lines of code vs 431+ lines
- Easy to understand and modify
- No Swift/Objective-C bridges needed

### 4. **Effectiveness**
- Detects TV availability accurately
- Prompts at the right time
- Connects reliably

## Future Enhancements

### Smart Learning (Optional)

Could add:
- **Time-based patterns**: Learn when you typically connect
- **Prompt timing**: "It's 7 PM - connect to TV?"
- **Auto-connect**: Skip prompt if you always say yes at certain times

### Multi-Display Support (Optional)

Could add:
- Monitor multiple TVs/displays
- Prompt for specific display based on time/context
- Remember display preferences per application

## Summary

This simple TV monitoring system:

✅ **Works** - Detects your Living Room TV
✅ **Simple** - No complicated proximity detection
✅ **Reliable** - Uses native macOS APIs
✅ **Effective** - Prompts and connects when needed

**The old way**:
- 431+ lines of Apple Watch/Bluetooth code
- Complex proximity calculations
- Multiple dependencies
- Overcomplicated

**The new way**:
- ~200 lines of simple monitoring code
- Just checks Screen Mirroring menu
- No external dependencies
- Clean and effective
