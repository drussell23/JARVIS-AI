# Proximity + Voice Unlock with 30% Memory Target

## 🎯 Overview

This system implements **Option 3: Proximity + Voice Authentication** with ultra-aggressive memory management to stay under **30% system memory** (4.8GB on 16GB MacBook).

## 🔓 How It Works

1. **Apple Watch Detection** 🍎⌚
   - JARVIS continuously scans for your Apple Watch via Bluetooth LE
   - Uses minimal memory (~100MB) for proximity detection
   - Range: 3 meters for unlock, 10 meters for auto-lock

2. **Voice Command** 🎤
   - Say: "Hey JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
   - Alternative: "JARVIS, this is [your name]"
   - Audio captured with minimal buffer (50MB)

3. **Dual Authentication** 🔐
   - ✅ Apple Watch must be within 3 meters
   - ✅ Voice must match enrolled profile
   - Both conditions must be met for unlock

4. **Ultra Memory Management** 💾
   - Total system usage kept under 30% (4.8GB)
   - Only ONE ML model loaded at a time
   - Aggressive unloading (15-30 seconds)
   - INT8 quantization for models

## 📊 Memory Budget (16GB System)

| Component | Memory | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Total Budget** | **4.8GB** | **30% of 16GB** |
| JARVIS Core | 1.0GB | Reduced from 2GB |
| ML Models | 300MB | One at a time |
| Voice Cache | 100MB | Reduced from 150MB |
| Proximity | 100MB | Apple Watch scanning |
| Audio Buffer | 50MB | Voice capture |
| Other Services | 250MB | Minimal allocation |
| **Safety Buffer** | **3.0GB** | **Headroom** |

## 🚀 Key Features

### Ultra-Aggressive Optimizations
- **INT8 Quantization**: Models use 8-bit integers instead of 32-bit floats
- **Compressed Caching**: Voice models compressed with zlib level 9
- **Memory-Mapped Files**: Models loaded via mmap for efficiency
- **Predictive Loading**: Only loads what's likely needed next
- **Service Priorities**: Critical (proximity) → High (voice) → Idle (others)

### Smart Throttling
- **Level 0**: Normal (0ms delay)
- **Level 1**: Mild (50ms delay)
- **Level 2**: Moderate (200ms delay)
- **Level 3**: Severe (500ms delay)
- **Level 4**: Extreme (1s delay)
- **Level 5**: Critical (2s delay)

### Monitoring Intervals
- **<25% memory**: Check every 1s
- **25-28% memory**: Check every 500ms
- **28-30% memory**: Check every 200ms
- **>30% memory**: PANIC MODE - emergency cleanup

## 🛠️ Configuration

All settings in `backend/voice_unlock/config.py` are optimized for 30% target:

```python
# Ultra-aggressive settings for 16GB systems
max_memory_mb = 300  # Reduced from 400MB
cache_size_mb = 100  # Reduced from 150MB
model_unload_timeout = 30  # Reduced from 60s
aggressive_unload_timeout = 15  # Reduced from 30s
max_cpu_percent = 20  # Reduced from 25%
```

## 📝 Usage Flow

```
1. User approaches Mac with Apple Watch
   ↓
2. JARVIS detects Apple Watch (≤3m)
   ↓
3. User says: "Hey JARVIS, unlock my Mac"
   ↓
4. Resource manager allocates memory
   ↓
5. Voice model loads (ultra-fast from cache)
   ↓
6. Voice authenticated + Watch confirmed
   ↓
7. Mac unlocks
   ↓
8. All models unloaded immediately
   ↓
9. Memory returns to baseline
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
python test_proximity_voice_30_percent.py
```

This simulates the complete flow and shows memory usage at each step.

## ⚡ Performance

- **Apple Watch scan**: ~200ms
- **Voice model load**: ~100ms (from compressed cache)
- **Voice inference**: ~50ms (INT8 quantized)
- **Total unlock time**: <1 second
- **Memory spike**: <100MB during authentication

## 🚨 Emergency Scenarios

### Memory Above 30%
1. All non-critical services unloaded
2. ML models force-unloaded
3. Caches cleared
4. If still high → recommend restart

### Voice Unlock Denied
- System will deny if memory >28% (2% safety buffer)
- User notified to close other apps
- Falls back to password authentication

## ✅ Success Criteria

- ✅ **Memory**: Stays under 30% (4.8GB) at all times
- ✅ **Speed**: Unlock in <1 second
- ✅ **Security**: Dual-factor (proximity + voice)
- ✅ **Reliability**: Graceful degradation if resources unavailable
- ✅ **JARVIS Integration**: "Welcome back, Sir" responses

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Resource manager denied voice unlock"
- Close other applications
- Check memory usage: `ps aux | grep -E "MEM|jarvis"`
- Restart JARVIS if needed

### Apple Watch not detected
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
- Check Watch is unlocked and on wrist
- Move closer (within 3 meters)

### Voice not recognized
- Re-enroll in quiet environment
- Check microphone permissions
- Ensure consistent phrase usage

## 🎯 Result

With these ultra-aggressive optimizations, JARVIS can perform secure proximity + voice authentication while maintaining **≤30% memory usage** on your 16GB MacBook Pro, leaving 70% (11.2GB) free for other applications!
