# WhatsApp Notification Detection Fix

## Issue
When asking JARVIS "do I have any notifications from WhatsApp", it was responding with "I don't have access to your WhatsApp notifications or account information" instead of using the workspace intelligence to check the screen.

## Root Cause
The query wasn't being recognized as a system/workspace command, so it was processed as a regular conversation instead of triggering the Multi-Window Intelligence system.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated System Keywords in jarvis_agent_voice.py
Added notification-related keywords:
```python
self.system_keywords = {
    # ... existing keywords ...
    "notifications", "notification", "whatsapp", "discord", "slack",
    "telegram", "signal", "teams", "mail", "email"
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Workspace Phrases
Added comprehensive notification phrases:
```python
workspace_phrases = [
    # ... existing phrases ...
    "any notifications", "do i have any notifications", "check notifications",
    "notifications from", "whatsapp notifications", "discord notifications",
    "slack notifications", "new notifications", "unread notifications",
    "notification from whatsapp", "notification from discord",
    "notification from slack", "check whatsapp", "check discord", "check slack"
]
```

### 3. Updated Workspace Triggers
Added notification triggers to the workspace command handler:
```python
workspace_triggers = [
    # ... existing triggers ...
    "any notifications", "check notifications", "notifications from",
    "whatsapp notification", "discord notification", "slack notification",
    "do i have any notifications", "new notifications", "unread notifications"
]
```

### 4. Enhanced Smart Query Router
Updated the NOTIFICATIONS intent patterns and routing logic:
- Added regex patterns for app-specific notifications
- Modified _route_notifications_query to handle specific app mentions
- Prioritizes the mentioned app (e.g., WhatsApp) when routing

## How It Works Now

1. User asks: "Do I have any notifications from WhatsApp?"
2. JARVIS detects this as a system command (notification keywords)
3. Routes to workspace intelligence system
4. Smart Query Router identifies NOTIFICATIONS intent
5. Specifically looks for WhatsApp windows
6. Captures WhatsApp (if open) or falls back to all communication apps
7. Analyzes the window for notification badges/indicators
8. Responds with actual screen content

## Examples

**Before Fix:**
- User: "Do I have any notifications from WhatsApp?"
- JARVIS: "I don't have access to your WhatsApp notifications..."

**After Fix:**
- User: "Do I have any notifications from WhatsApp?"
- JARVIS: "Sir, WhatsApp is open. I can see 3 unread messages in the chat list."

OR if WhatsApp isn't open:
- JARVIS: "Sir, WhatsApp is not currently open on your screen."

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Restart JARVIS to load the updated code
2. Open WhatsApp (or any communication app)
3. Say: "Hey JARVIS, do I have any notifications from WhatsApp?"
4. JARVIS should analyze your screen and report what it sees

- "Any notifications?"
- "Check WhatsApp notifications"
- "Do I have Discord notifications?"
- "Any new notifications from Slack?"
- "Check my notifications"
- "WhatsApp notifications"
