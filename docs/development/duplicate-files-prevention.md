# Duplicate Files Prevention System

## Overview
This document describes the measures implemented to prevent duplicate files (files with " 2", " copy", or "(2)" in their names) from being created and committed to the repository.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Updated .gitignore
Added patterns to ignore all common duplicate file formats:
```
# Duplicate files prevention
* 2.*
* 2
*\ 2.*
*\ 2
* copy.*
* copy
*-copy.*
*-copy
*(2).*
*(2)
*\(2\).*
*\(2\)
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hook
Created `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that:
- Automatically checks for duplicate files before each commit
- Prevents commits containing duplicate files
- Provides clear error messages and removal instructions

### 3. Cleanup Script
Created `scripts/clean_duplicates.sh` that:
- Removes all duplicate files from the repository
- Provides detailed reporting of what was cleaned
- Can be run periodically to ensure cleanliness

## Usage

### Running the Cleanup Script
```bash
./scripts/clean_duplicates.sh
```

### Testing the Prevention System
Try creating and committing a duplicate file:
```bash
touch "test 2.txt"
git add "test 2.txt"  # This will be ignored by .gitignore
git add -f "test 2.txt"  # Force add to test pre-commit hook
git commit -m "test"  # This will be blocked by pre-commit hook
```

## How Duplicate Files Are Created

Common causes of duplicate files:
1. **Editor "Save As"**: Some editors create copies with " 2" when saving
2. **File Managers**: Copying files in Finder/Explorer often adds " copy"
3. **Download Duplicates**: Browsers add "(2)" to downloaded files
4. **Sync Conflicts**: Cloud sync services may create conflict copies

## Best Practices

1. **Use git mv**: When renaming files, use `git mv old.txt new.txt`
2. **Check before committing**: Run `git status` to review changes
3. **Clean regularly**: Run the cleanup script periodically
4. **Be mindful of saves**: Use Ctrl+S instead of "Save As" when possible

## Maintenance

The prevention system requires minimal maintenance:
- The .gitignore patterns are comprehensive
- The pre-commit hook runs automatically
- The cleanup script can be run as needed

## Recovery

If you accidentally need a "duplicate" file:
1. Rename it to something meaningful: `mv "file 2.txt" "file_v2.txt"`
2. Or force add it (not recommended): `git add -f "file 2.txt"`

## Summary

With these measures in place:
- ✅ Duplicate files are automatically ignored by git
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental commits
- ✅ Cleanup script removes existing duplicates
- ✅ Clear documentation for team members

The repository should remain free of duplicate files going forward!
