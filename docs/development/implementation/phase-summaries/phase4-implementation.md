## Usage Example

```python
from vision.vision_system_v2 import get_vision_system_v2

# Initialize system with Phase 4
system = get_vision_system_v2()

# Process commands - experiences are automatically recorded
response = await system.process_command(
    "Can you analyze this error message?",
    context={'user': 'john_doe', 'error_present': True}
)

# Check if Phase 4 is active
if response.data.get('phase4_enabled'):
    print("✅ Continuous learning active")
    
# Get learning status
if system.advanced_learning:
    status = system.advanced_learning.get_status()
    print(f"Experiences collected: {status['experience_replay']['buffer_stats']['current_size']}")
    print(f"Patterns discovered: {status['experience_replay']['pattern_stats']['total_patterns']}")
    print(f"Current learning rate: {status['learning_rate']:.6f}")
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Self-Improving**: Learns from every interaction automatically
2. **Pattern Discovery**: Identifies common usage patterns and optimizes for them
3. **Robust Learning**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge
4. **Privacy-First**: Federated learning with differential privacy
5. **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts learning strategies based on performance

## Testing

Run the comprehensive Phase 4 test suite:
```bash
python test_vision_v2_phase4.py
```

For a quick functionality check:
```bash
python test_phase4_simple.py
```

## Technical Details

### Experience Prioritization Formula
```python
importance = base_score
if not success: importance *= 2.0
if confidence < 0.5: importance *= 1.5
if latency_ms > 100: importance *= 1.3
if user_feedback < 3: importance *= 1.5
```

### EWC Loss Calculation
```python
ewc_loss = λ * Σ(F_i * (θ_i - θ*_i)²)
```
Where:
- F_i: Fisher Information for parameter i
- θ_i: Current parameter value
- θ*_i: Optimal parameter value from previous task
- λ: Regularization strength (0.1)

### Differential Privacy Noise
```python
noise ~ Laplace(0, sensitivity/epsilon)
epsilon = 1.0  # Privacy budget
sensitivity = 0.1  # Estimated parameter sensitivity
```

## Memory and Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: ~1GB for full 10K experience buffer with embeddings
- **Background CPU**: 1-2% for pattern extraction threads
- **Retraining Time**: ~5 minutes for full retraining cycle
- **Mini-batch Time**: <30 seconds for incremental updates

## Future Enhancements

1. **Neural Architecture Search**: Automatically evolve model architecture
2. **Multi-Task Learning**: Simultaneous optimization for multiple objectives
3. **Active Learning**: Query user for labels on uncertain examples
4. **Continual Pre-training**: Update language model embeddings
5. **Edge Deployment**: Lightweight learning for resource-constrained devices

## Conclusion

Phase 4 completes the JARVIS Vision System v2.0 by adding sophisticated continuous learning capabilities. The system now:
- **Remembers** every interaction in a prioritized buffer
- **Learns** patterns from user behavior automatically
- **Adapts** its learning strategy based on performance
- **Prevents** forgetting of previously learned tasks
- **Preserves** privacy through differential privacy
- **Improves** continuously without manual intervention

The implementation provides a solid foundation for a truly intelligent, self-improving AI assistant that gets better with every use while respecting user privacy and maintaining consistent performance across all learned capabilities.
