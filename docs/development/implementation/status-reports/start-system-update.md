# start_system.py Updates Summary

## What Was Updated

### 1. Backend Startup Method
The `start_backend_optimized()` method now prioritizes the robust startup approach:

1. **First Choice**: Uses `start_backend_robust.py` if it exists
   - Handles high CPU situations automatically
   - Waits for system resources to be available
   - Retries startup with proper error handling
   - Configures memory optimization based on available RAM

2. **Fallback**: Uses direct main.py startup if robust starter not found

### 2. Key Features Added
- ✅ CPU monitoring and automatic waiting
- ✅ Process cleanup integration (already present)
- ✅ Swift performance bridge configuration
- ✅ Memory optimization based on system state
- ✅ Automatic retry on failure (3 attempts)
- ✅ Better logging with separate log files

### 3. How It Works
```bash
# Standard start with optimization
python start_system.py

# Backend only with auto cleanup
python start_system.py --backend-only --auto-cleanup

# Check what would be cleaned without doing it
python start_system.py --check-only
```

### 4. Benefits
1. **More Reliable**: Backend will start even under high CPU load
2. **Self-Healing**: Automatically cleans up stuck processes
3. **Resource Aware**: Adjusts memory settings based on available RAM
4. **Better Debugging**: Separate log files for robust startup

## No Breaking Changes
All existing functionality remains the same. The update only improves reliability and adds the robust startup as the preferred method when available.
