# Response Formatting Fix for JARVIS Multi-Window

## Issue
Test results showing garbled responses with section markers appearing in output:
- "Sir, You're NOTIFICATIONS: No window changes detected..."
- "Sir, CONTEXT: The workspace also includes..."

## Root Cause
The Claude API response format includes section headers (PRIMARY TASK:, CONTEXT:, etc.) that were not being properly stripped from the final response.

## Solution
Updated response parsing and formatting to:

1. **Properly parse section markers** in `workspace_analyzer.py`:
   - Extract content after section headers
   - Handle numbered formats (1. PRIMARY TASK:)
   - Skip empty sections marked as "none" or "n/a"

2. **Clean up any leaked markers** in `jarvis_workspace_integration.py`:
   - Strip all section markers from responses
   - Clean up in all formatting methods
   - Ensure consistent output format

3. **Improved fallback handling**:
   - If parsing fails, extract meaningful content directly
   - Create sensible defaults from window information
   - Always provide clean, marker-free responses

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
Response: Sir, CONTEXT: The workspace also includes windows for Cursor, Google Chrome, and Finder..
Response: Sir, You're NOTIFICATIONS: No window changes detected in 3 seconds...
```

### After Fix:
```
Response: Sir, you're working in Cursor on test_multi_window_phase1.py. Also using: Chrome, Finder.
Response: Sir, you're working on the JARVIS-AI-Agent project.
```

## Testing
The fix ensures:
- No section markers appear in final responses
- Clean, concise output
- Proper extraction of task information
- Supporting apps listed when relevant
- Critical notifications only when needed
