# PRD Completion Summary: JARVIS Multi-Window Awareness System

## Executive Summary

All features specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) have been successfully implemented. JARVIS has evolved from a single-window AI assistant into the world's first **Workspace Intelligence Agent** capable of understanding and analyzing entire digital workspaces across multiple applications simultaneously.

## Completed User Stories

- ✅ Understands relationships between code, docs, and terminal output
- ✅ Provides insights that consider the full development context
- ✅ Can answer "What error corresponds to the documentation I have open?"

**Implementation**:
- Window relationship detection identifies IDE + Terminal + Documentation groups
- Smart query routing ensures error queries scan terminals and development windows
- Cross-application debugging works through intelligent window correlation

### ✅ Story 2: Meeting Preparation

**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Identifies meeting-related windows (Calendar, Zoom, Notes, documents)
- ✅ Alerts about conflicts or missing materials
- ✅ Suggests window arrangement for screen sharing
- ✅ Hides sensitive windows automatically

**Implementation**:
- `meeting_preparation.py` - Complete meeting preparation system
- Meeting-specific layouts: presentation_mode, collaboration_mode, meeting_focus
- Sensitive window detection with automatic hiding recommendations
- Integration with privacy controls for screen sharing safety

### ✅ Story 3: Message Monitoring

**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Monitors Discord, Slack, Email windows without active focus
- ✅ Identifies urgent or relevant messages
- ✅ Provides contextual notifications
- ✅ Respects do-not-disturb preferences

**Implementation**:
- Proactive Insights system monitors communication windows in background
- Context-aware alerts that won't interrupt focused coding
- Smart routing for message queries targets only communication apps
- 5-second monitoring interval for lightweight background checking

## Completed Use Cases

### ✅ Use Case 1: Cross-Application Debugging

- **Trigger**: "What's causing this error?"
- **Result**: JARVIS analyzes Terminal, VS Code, and Chrome documentation
- **Success**: Correctly identifies relationships and provides unified insight

### ✅ Use Case 2: Workflow Status Check

- **Trigger**: "What am I working on?"
- **Result**: Comprehensive summary mentioning all relevant applications
- **Success**: Prioritizes focused window while showing complete context

## Success Metrics Achieved
