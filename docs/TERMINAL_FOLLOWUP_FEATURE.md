# Terminal Follow-Up Deep Analysis Feature

**Date:** October 9th, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Works With:** Text input AND voice commands

---

## 🎯 What This Does

Enables natural, multi-turn conversations about terminals and windows in other desktops:

**Before (Limited):**
```
You: "can you see my terminal in the other window?"
JARVIS: "Yes, I can see Terminal on Desktop 2..."
[END - no way to ask more]
```

**After (Intelligent Follow-Up):**
```
You: "can you see my terminal in the other window?"
JARVIS: "Yes, I can see Terminal on Desktop 2, while we're currently viewing
         the J.A.R.V.I.S. Interface on Desktop 1."

[JARVIS automatically tracks this as a follow-up opportunity]

You: "what does it say?"  or "are there any errors?"  or "tell me more"
JARVIS: **Terminal Analysis:**

        I found these issues:
        • ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
        • SyntaxError: invalid syntax on line 45

        **Recommended fixes:**
        → Run: pip install requests
        → Check line 45 for missing closing parenthesis

        Would you like me to help you resolve any of these?

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Opportunity Detection**

When you ask JARVIS about terminals/windows, the system intelligently detects if this is a "discovery" question:

**Detection Triggers:**
- User asks: `"can you see"`, `"do you see"`, `"what do you see"`, `"show me"`, `"what's on"`, `"what's in"`
- JARVIS mentions: `terminal`, `browser`, `code`, `window`, `desktop`
- Response is brief (< 50 words = surface-level observation)

**Example:**
```python
# In pure_vision_intelligence.py
User: "can you see my terminal?"
JARVIS: "Yes, I can see Terminal on Desktop 2..."  # 11 words = brief

# System automatically tracks:
- Window type: "terminal"
- Space ID: "2" (extracted from "Desktop 2")
- Pending question: "Would you like me to read what's in the Terminal?"
- TTL: 180 seconds (3 minutes to ask follow-up)
```

### 2. **Context Tracking**

The system stores:
```python
{
  "context_id": "ctx_abc123",
  "window_type": "terminal",
  "window_id": "terminal_2",
  "space_id": "2",
  "snapshot_id": "snap_xyz",
  "summary": "User asked 'can you see my terminal', JARVIS responded 'Yes, I can see Terminal on Desktop 2...'",
  "ttl_seconds": 180,
  "created_at": "2025-10-09T15:30:00"
}
```

### 3. **Follow-Up Detection**

When you ask a follow-up question:

**Follow-Up Triggers:**
- `"yes"`, `"okay"`, `"sure"`, `"go ahead"`
- `"what does it say"`, `"tell me more"`, `"show me"`
- `"are there errors"`, `"what's wrong"`
- `"describe it"`, `"read it"`

**System Flow:**
```
User: "what does it say?"
  ↓
AsyncPipeline detects "follow_up" intent (confidence: 0.92)
  ↓
Retrieves pending context: ctx_abc123 (age: 15s)
  ↓
Routes to VisionFollowUpHandler → handle_terminal_follow_up()
  ↓
Captures Desktop 2 screenshot
  ↓
Performs OCR to extract terminal text
  ↓
Analyzes for errors using 30+ error patterns
  ↓
Returns detailed analysis with fixes
```

### 4. **Deep Terminal Analysis**

Once triggered, the handler:

**Step 1: Capture Terminal**
```python
# Get screenshot of specific desktop space
screenshot = await detector.capture_specific_space(space_id=2)
```

**Step 2: Extract Text (OCR)**
```python
ocr_text = await ocr_processor.extract_text(screenshot)
# Example output:
# """
# $ python test.py
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "test.py", line 5, in <module>
#     import requests
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
# """
```

**Step 3: Error Detection**
```python
errors = extract_errors(ocr_text)
# Detects 30+ error patterns:
# - Python: ModuleNotFoundError, SyntaxError, TypeError, etc.
# - JavaScript: ReferenceError, TypeError, etc.
# - Shell: command not found, permission denied, etc.
# - Git: fatal errors, merge conflicts, etc.
```

**Step 4: Generate Fixes**
```python
for error in errors:
    fix = suggest_fix(error)
    # "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'"
    # → "Run: pip install requests"
```

**Step 5: Intelligent Response**
```python
if errors:
    return f"""
    **Terminal Analysis:**

    I found these issues:
    • {error_1}
    • {error_2}

    **Recommended fixes:**
    → {fix_1}
    → {fix_2}

    Would you like me to help you resolve any of these?
    """
else:
    return f"""
    Your Terminal shows recent command output:

    ```
    {last_10_lines}
    ```

    Everything looks clean! No errors detected.
    """
```

## 💬 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Error Detection

```
You: can you see my terminal in the other window?

JARVIS: Yes, I can see Terminal open on Desktop 2, while we're currently
        viewing the J.A.R.V.I.S. Interface on Desktop 1.

You: what does it say?

JARVIS: **Terminal Analysis:**

        I found these issues:
        • ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests' at line 5

        **Recommended fixes:**
        → Run: pip install requests

        Would you like me to help you resolve any of these?

You: yes

JARVIS: I'll help you install the requests module. You can run:

        ```bash
        pip install requests
        ```

        This will install the missing package and resolve the error.
```

### Example 2: No Errors

```
You: can you see my terminal?

JARVIS: Yes, I can see Terminal on Desktop 3, Sir.

You: are there any errors?

JARVIS: Your Terminal shows recent command output:

        ```
        $ npm install
        added 245 packages in 12s
        $ npm run dev
        > dev
        > next dev

        ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000
        ```

        Everything looks clean! No errors detected.
```

### Example 3: Code Running

```
You: what's in my terminal?

JARVIS: I can see Terminal running on Desktop 2.

You: tell me more

JARVIS: I can see code execution in progress. The output looks normal
        with no errors. The last few lines show:

        ```
        Running test suite...
        ✓ Test 1 passed
        ✓ Test 2 passed
        ✓ Test 3 passed
        ```
```

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Context tracking
CONTEXT_TTL_SECONDS=180        # 3 minutes to ask follow-up
MAX_PENDING_CONTEXTS=100       # Track up to 100 opportunities

# Follow-up detection
FOLLOW_UP_ENABLED=true
FOLLOW_UP_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.75  # Intent detection threshold
```

### Supported Window Types

1. **Terminal** - Full OCR + error detection
2. **Browser** - Page content extraction
3. **Code Editor** - Syntax error detection
4. **General** - Basic text extraction

---

## 🚀 Works With Both Text & Voice

**Text Input (Web Interface):**
```
You type: "can you see my terminal?"
JARVIS: "Yes, I can see Terminal on Desktop 2..."
You type: "what does it say?"
JARVIS: [Performs deep analysis]
```

**Voice Input:**
```
You say: "Hey JARVIS, can you see my terminal?"
JARVIS: "Yes, I can see Terminal on Desktop 2..."
You say: "what does it say?"
JARVIS: [Performs deep analysis and speaks the result]
```

Both inputs go through the same pipeline:
```
Input (text or voice)
  ↓
AsyncPipeline._process_command()
  ↓
Intent Detection
  ↓
Follow-Up Handler
  ↓
Terminal Analysis
  ↓
Response (text or speech)
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Natural Conversations** - Ask follow-up questions like talking to a person
2. **Context Awareness** - JARVIS remembers what you just asked about
3. **Deep Analysis** - Actually reads terminal content, not just sees it exists
4. **Error Detection** - 30+ error patterns across multiple languages
5. **Actionable Fixes** - Suggests specific commands to resolve issues
6. **Multi-Desktop** - Works across all desktop spaces
7. **Voice + Text** - Works with both input methods seamlessly

---

## 🧪 Testing

**Manual Test:**
1. Open terminal on Desktop 2 with an error
2. Switch to Desktop 1 (JARVIS interface)
3. Type or say: "can you see my terminal?"
4. Wait for JARVIS response
5. Type or say: "what does it say?"
6. Verify deep analysis with error detection

**Expected Flow:**
```
✅ Initial question detected
✅ Opportunity tracked (check logs for "[FOLLOW-UP] Tracked opportunity")
✅ Follow-up intent detected (check logs for "[FOLLOW-UP] Detected follow-up intent")
✅ Terminal captured from Desktop 2
✅ OCR extraction successful
✅ Errors detected and fixes suggested
```
