# Purple Indicator and Vision Status Integration

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the purple indicator persistence and vision status synchronization for JARVIS.

## Problem Statement
1. Purple indicator disappears after a few seconds when monitoring starts
2. Vision status shows "disconnected" even when monitoring is active
3. No correlation between purple indicator and vision status

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Infinite Purple Capture (Swift)
- **File**: `vision/infinite_purple_capture.swift`
- **Purpose**: Maintains AVCaptureSession indefinitely
- **Features**:
  - Automatic session restart if stopped
  - Frame counting to verify active capture
  - Vision status signaling via stdout
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### 2. Direct Swift Capture (Python)
- **File**: `vision/direct_swift_capture.py`
- **Updates**:
  - Uses infinite_purple_capture.swift instead of persistent_capture.swift
  - Monitors Swift output for [VISION_STATUS] signals
  - Calls vision status callback on connect/disconnect

### 3. Vision Status Manager
- **File**: `vision/vision_status_manager.py`
- **Purpose**: Central coordination of vision status
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket broadcasting of status changes
  - Multiple callback support
  - Status tracking and querying

### 4. Vision Status Integration
- **File**: `vision/vision_status_integration.py`
- **Purpose**: Connects vision status to main application
- **Features**:
  - Initializes during startup
  - Connects to WebSocket manager
  - Updates JARVIS UI

### 5. Multi-Space Capture Integration
- **File**: `vision/multi_space_capture_engine.py`
- **Updates**:
  - Sets vision status callback when starting monitoring
  - Properly propagates status changes

## How It Works

1. **Starting Monitoring**:
   ```
   User: "Start monitoring my screen"
   â†’ MultiSpaceCaptureEngine.start_monitoring_session()
   â†’ DirectSwiftCapture.start_capture()
   â†’ Swift: infinite_purple_capture.swift --start
   â†’ Purple indicator appears
   â†’ Swift outputs: [VISION_STATUS] connected
   â†’ DirectSwiftCapture detects signal
   â†’ Calls vision_status_callback(True)
   â†’ VisionStatusManager.update_vision_status(True)
   â†’ WebSocket broadcasts: {"type": "vision_status_update", "status": {"connected": true, ...}}
   â†’ UI updates: "Vision: connected" (green)
   ```

2. **Maintaining Connection**:
   - Swift process runs with RunLoop.main.run()
   - Keep-alive timer checks session every 5 seconds
   - Automatically restarts session if stopped
   - Frame counter verifies active capture
   - Purple indicator stays visible indefinitely

3. **Stopping Monitoring**:
   ```
   User: "Stop monitoring"
   â†’ MultiSpaceCaptureEngine.stop_monitoring_session()
   â†’ DirectSwiftCapture.stop_capture()
   â†’ Swift process terminated
   â†’ Purple indicator disappears
   â†’ vision_status_callback(False)
   â†’ VisionStatusManager.update_vision_status(False)
   â†’ WebSocket broadcasts: {"type": "vision_status_update", "status": {"connected": false, ...}}
   â†’ UI updates: "Vision: disconnected" (red)
   ```

## WebSocket Message Format

```json
{
  "type": "vision_status_update",
  "status": {
    "connected": true,
    "text": "Vision: connected",
    "color": "green",
    "indicator": "ðŸŸ¢",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123456"
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Purple Indicator Persistence
```bash
cd backend
python test_purple_vision_status.py
```

### Test Activity Reporting with Status
```bash
python test_activity_reporting.py
```

### Manual Test
1. Start JARVIS backend
2. Say "Start monitoring my screen"
3. Observe:
   - Purple indicator appears and stays visible
   - Vision status changes from red "disconnected" to green "connected"
4. Wait 30+ seconds - purple indicator should remain
5. Say "Stop monitoring"
6. Observe:
   - Purple indicator disappears
   - Vision status changes back to red "disconnected"

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system automatically:
- Detects if Swift capture is available
- Falls back gracefully if permissions denied
- Maintains status synchronization

## Troubleshooting

### Purple Indicator Disappears
1. Check Swift permissions: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Screen Recording
2. Verify infinite_purple_capture.swift is being used (not persistent_capture.swift)
3. Check logs for [KEEPALIVE] messages

### Vision Status Not Updating
1. Verify WebSocket connection is established
2. Check vision_status_manager is initialized
3. Look for [VISION_STATUS] messages in logs

### Common Issues
- **Permission Denied**: Grant screen recording permission to Terminal
- **Swift Process Crashes**: Check for conflicting capture sessions
- **WebSocket Not Connected**: Ensure unified_websocket is properly mounted

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **infinite_purple_capture.swift**: Core Swift capture with infinite loop
2. **DirectSwiftCapture**: Python wrapper with status monitoring
3. **VisionStatusManager**: Status coordination and broadcasting
4. **UnifiedWebSocketManager**: WebSocket message distribution
5. **MultiSpaceCaptureEngine**: Integration point for monitoring

### Status Flow
```
Swift Process â†’ Python Monitor â†’ Status Manager â†’ WebSocket â†’ UI
```

### State Management
- Purple indicator state: Managed by Swift AVCaptureSession
- Vision connection state: Managed by VisionStatusManager
- UI state: Updated via WebSocket broadcasts

## Concise Response Update

### Problem
When users said "start monitoring my screen", JARVIS would give a long technical explanation about being in manual mode, vision disconnected, and listing all available options.

### Solution
Updated the vision command handler prompts to enforce concise responses:

#### Start Monitoring Response
- **Before**: Long technical explanation (500+ characters)
- **After**: "Screen monitoring is now active, Sir. The purple indicator is visible in your menu bar, and I can see your desktop." (1-2 sentences)

#### Stop Monitoring Response
- **Before**: Multiple sentences explaining the process
- **After**: "Screen monitoring has been disabled, Sir." (1 sentence)

### Implementation
- Added specific examples in prompts
- Enforced character/sentence limits
- Removed technical detail requirements
- Added "BE CONCISE" instructions

## Benefits
1. **Persistent Monitoring**: Purple indicator stays visible during entire session
2. **Real-time Status**: Vision status updates immediately on connect/disconnect
3. **Reliable State**: Automatic recovery if capture session stops
4. **User Feedback**: Clear visual indication of monitoring status

## Future Enhancements
1. Add reconnection attempts with backoff
2. Store monitoring preferences
3. Add monitoring duration tracking
4. Support multiple monitoring sessions
