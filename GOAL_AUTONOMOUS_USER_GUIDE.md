# Goal Inference + Autonomous Decision Engine - User Guide

## üéØ What This Does For You

Instead of just executing commands, JARVIS now:
1. **Predicts what you need** before you ask
2. **Learns your patterns** and automates them
3. **Proactively suggests actions** based on context
4. **Connects displays faster** through prediction

---

## üöÄ How to Activate

### Option 1: Integrate with Unified Command Processor

Add this to your main JARVIS initialization:

```python
# In your main.py or jarvis startup
from backend.intelligence.goal_autonomous_uae_integration import get_integration

# Initialize the integration
goal_autonomous_integration = get_integration()

# Use it in your command flow
async def process_command(command, context):
    # First, check for predictive suggestions
    decisions = await goal_autonomous_integration.process_context(context)

    if decisions:
        # Present proactive suggestions to user
        for decision in decisions:
            if decision.integrated_confidence > 0.8:
                print(f"JARVIS: {decision.reasoning}")
                print(f"         Shall I {decision.action.action_type}?")

    # Then process the actual command normally
    # ... your existing command processing
```

### Option 2: Add to Voice Command Handler

```python
# In backend/voice/jarvis_agent_voice.py

from backend.intelligence.goal_autonomous_uae_integration import get_integration

class JARVISVoice:
    def __init__(self):
        self.integration = get_integration()

    async def process_voice_command(self, command, context):
        # Check for predictive display connection
        if "tv" in command.lower() or "display" in command.lower():
            display_prediction = await self.integration.predict_display_connection(context)

            if display_prediction:
                # Execute immediately (already predicted)
                await self.integration.execute_decision(display_prediction, context)
                return f"Connected to {display_prediction.action.target}, sir. I anticipated your request."

        # Continue with normal processing
        # ...
```

## üëÄ What You'll See as a User

### **Scenario 1: Meeting Preparation**

**Before (without integration):**
```
You: "connect to living room tv"
JARVIS: *connects in 0.7s*
JARVIS: "Connected to Living Room TV"
```

**After (with integration):**
```
[2:55 PM - You open Keynote for 3:00 PM meeting]

JARVIS: "Sir, I notice you have a team meeting in 5 minutes.
         Your presentation is open in Keynote.
         Shall I connect to Living Room TV?"

You: "yes"

JARVIS: *connects in 0.2s*
JARVIS: "Living Room TV connected, sir. Your presentation is ready."
```

### **Scenario 2: Daily Standup Pattern**

**Week 1:**
```
Monday 9:00 AM
You: "living room tv"
JARVIS: *connects*
```

**Week 2:**
```
Monday 8:58 AM
JARVIS: "Sir, it's almost 9:00 AM. Your daily standup is in 2 minutes.
         Shall I connect to Living Room TV?"

You: "yes please"
JARVIS: *connects instantly*
```

**Week 3:**
```
Monday 8:58 AM
JARVIS: "Sir, I've noticed you connect to Living Room TV every Monday
         at 9 AM for your standup. Would you like me to do this
         automatically?"

You: "yes, automate it"
JARVIS: "Understood. I'll connect automatically from now on, sir."

[Next Monday, 8:59 AM]
JARVIS: "Automatically connecting to Living Room TV for your standup, sir."
*connects without asking*
```

### **Scenario 3: Context-Aware Defaults**

**Before:**
```
You: "connect display"
JARVIS: "Which display would you like to connect to?"
You: "living room tv"
JARVIS: *connects*
```

**After:**
```
[You have Keynote + Calendar meeting in context]

You: "connect display"
JARVIS: "Connecting to Living Room TV based on your presentation
         preparation, sir."
*connects instantly*
```

## üîç How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check the Logs

Look for these messages in your JARVIS logs:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export JARVIS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run JARVIS and look for:
[Goal Inference] Inferred goals: meeting_preparation (confidence: 0.92)
[Autonomous Engine] Generated 3 decisions from goals
[Integration] Predictive display connection: Living Room TV (confidence: 0.89)
[UAE] High confidence element position for Living Room TV
[Integration] Executing integrated decision: connect_display
```

### 2. Monitor Metrics

Add this to your code to see metrics:

```python
from backend.intelligence.goal_autonomous_uae_integration import get_integration

integration = get_integration()
metrics = integration.get_metrics()

print(f"Goals Inferred: {metrics['goals_inferred']}")
print(f"Predictions Made: {metrics['total_predictions']}")
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['prediction_accuracy']:.0%}")
```

### 3. Test Scenarios

Try these test scenarios:

```bash
# Scenario 1: Meeting preparation
1. Open Calendar app
2. Create a meeting in 10 minutes
3. Open Keynote or PowerPoint
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. JARVIS should suggest display connection

# Scenario 2: Pattern learning
1. Connect to TV at the same time for 3 days in a row
2. On day 4, JARVIS should offer to automate
3. Accept automation
4. Day 5 should auto-connect

# Scenario 3: Context understanding
1. Just say "display" without specifying which one
2. JARVIS should choose Living Room TV if context matches
```

## üìä Understanding the Confidence Scores

The system uses confidence scores to decide when to act:

| Confidence | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| **95%+** | Auto-execute (if user allowed automation) |
| **85-95%** | Proactive suggestion with high confidence |
| **75-85%** | Suggest, but wait for confirmation |
| **60-75%** | Mention as possibility |
| **<60%** | Don't suggest (too uncertain) |

---

## üéì Training the System

The system learns from:

1. **Your patterns**: When you connect, what apps are open, time of day
2. **Your confirmations**: When you say "yes" to suggestions
3. **Your corrections**: When you say "no" or choose different option
4. **Your feedback**: Explicit feedback like "don't do this again"

To train it faster:

```python
# After an action, provide feedback
from backend.intelligence.goal_autonomous_uae_integration import get_integration

integration = get_integration()

# If JARVIS did something good
integration.autonomous_engine.learn_from_feedback(
    action,
    success=True,
    user_feedback="This was exactly what I needed"
)

# If JARVIS was wrong
integration.autonomous_engine.learn_from_feedback(
    action,
    success=False,
    user_feedback="Don't connect display during meetings"
)
```

---

## üîß Configuration

Create `backend/config/integration_config.json`:

```json
{
  "min_goal_confidence": 0.75,
  "min_decision_confidence": 0.70,
  "enable_predictive_display": true,
  "max_concurrent_goals": 10,
  "learning_enabled": true,
  "auto_connect_threshold": 0.85,
  "proactive_suggestions": true,
  "automation_allowed": false
}
```

Adjust these settings:
- `min_goal_confidence`: How sure must we be about a goal? (lower = more suggestions, higher = fewer but more accurate)
- `auto_connect_threshold`: How confident before auto-executing? (higher = safer)
- `automation_allowed`: Allow full automation after learning patterns?

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No proactive suggestions appearing"

**Check:**
1. Is `enable_predictive_display` true in config?
2. Are confidence thresholds too high?
3. Is the context rich enough? (need apps, time info, etc.)
4. Check logs for goal inference results

**Fix:**
```python
# Lower the thresholds temporarily
integration.config['min_goal_confidence'] = 0.65
integration.config['auto_connect_threshold'] = 0.75
```

### "Wrong display suggested"

**Cause:** System hasn't learned your preferences yet

**Fix:**
```python
# Teach it your preference
integration.autonomous_engine.learned_patterns['display_preferences'] = {
    'meeting_preparation': 'Living Room TV',
    'project_completion': 'External Monitor',
    'presentation': 'Living Room TV'
}
```

### "Too many suggestions"

**Fix:**
```python
# Increase confidence thresholds
integration.config['min_goal_confidence'] = 0.85
integration.config['min_decision_confidence'] = 0.80
```

| Week | Expected Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| **Week 1** | Basic goal inference, occasional suggestions |
| **Week 2** | Pattern recognition starts, more relevant suggestions |
| **Week 3** | Learns your daily routines, offers automation |
| **Week 4** | High accuracy predictions, faster responses |
| **Month 2** | Proactive automation, anticipates your needs |
| **Month 3** | Fully integrated into workflow, seamless operation |

---

## üéØ Key Differences: Before vs After

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Speed** | 0.7s | <0.3s (predicted) |
| **Proactivity** | None | Suggests before you ask |
| **Learning** | Static | Learns and improves |
| **Context** | Command-based | Goal-based understanding |
| **Automation** | Manual every time | Can automate patterns |
| **Intelligence** | Reactive | Predictive + Adaptive |

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

‚úì JARVIS suggests display connection before you ask
‚úì Connections happen noticeably faster
‚úì Suggestions are contextually relevant
‚úì System learns and remembers your patterns
‚úì Automation offers appear after repeated actions
‚úì Fewer words needed ("display" instead of "connect to living room tv")
‚úì JARVIS explains reasoning ("based on your meeting...")

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Activate** the integration in your main JARVIS flow
2. **Use it** normally for a few days
3. **Watch** for proactive suggestions
4. **Confirm** good suggestions to reinforce learning
