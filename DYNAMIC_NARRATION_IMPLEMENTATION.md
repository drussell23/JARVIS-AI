# Dynamic Real-Time Voice Narration for Document Writing

## Overview
JARVIS now provides **fully dynamic, context-aware voice narration** during essay/document creation with **ZERO hardcoded responses**. Every narration is generated in real-time by Claude API based on the current context.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Narration Generation**
- All narration messages are generated by Claude API in real-time
- No hardcoded or generic responses
- Context-aware updates that reference specific details (topic, section, progress, etc.)
- Natural, conversational tone that matches JARVIS's personality

### 2. **Real-Time Progress Updates**
JARVIS narrates at every stage:
- ✅ Request acknowledgment
- ✅ Service initialization
- ✅ Document creation
- ✅ Browser opening
- ✅ Outline generation
- ✅ Each section being written
- ✅ Word count milestones (every 50 words)
- ✅ Completion summary

### 3. **Context-Aware Narration**
Each narration includes:
- Current phase of document creation
- Progress percentage
- Word count (current vs target)
- Current section being written
- Document type and format
- Topic being written about

### 4. **Voice Feedback Integration**
- Narration is sent both as text AND as voice output
- WebSocket messages trigger voice synthesis
- Real-time updates spoken as they happen

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Narration Context Tracking
```python
self._narration_context = {
    "phase": "writing_section",
    "topic": "climate change",
    "document_type": "essay",
    "format": "mla",
    "progress": 75,
    "word_count": 750,
    "total_words_target": 1000,
    "current_section": "Solutions and Mitigation"
}
```

#### 2. Dynamic Narration Generator
```python
async def _generate_dynamic_narration(self, context_update: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Generate natural narration using Claude API based on context"""
```

The method:
- Updates internal context with new information
- Builds a prompt for Claude describing current status
- Asks Claude to generate a natural JARVIS-style narration
- Returns the generated narration for voice output

#### 3. Enhanced Narrate Method
```python
async def _narrate(self, progress_callback, websocket, message=None, context=None):
    """Send narration with dynamic generation and voice output"""
```

The method:
- Generates dynamic narration if context is provided
- Sends narration as text message
- Triggers voice output via WebSocket

### Usage Examples

#### Before (Hardcoded):
```python
await self._narrate(callback, ws, "Starting to write the document...")
```

#### After (Dynamic):
```python
await self._narrate(callback, ws, context={
    "phase": "starting_writing",
    "progress": 55,
    "current_section": "Introduction"
})
```

JARVIS might say:
- "I'm starting with the introduction section now, Sir."
- "Beginning the introduction - this will set up your climate change essay nicely."
- "Working on the introduction now, laying the groundwork for your argument."

## Real-Time Streaming Updates

During content generation:
- Updates every 50 words with current progress
- Announces each section transition dynamically
- Provides word count and percentage milestones
- All narration is unique and contextual

Example narration during writing:
1. "I've completed 200 words of your essay, focusing on the causes of climate change."
2. "Moving to the solutions section now - we're at 450 words, halfway there."
3. "Writing the conclusion - 850 words done, almost complete."

## Benefits

### For User Experience:
- **Engaging**: Natural conversation keeps you informed
- **Transparent**: Know exactly what's happening at each step
- **Professional**: JARVIS personality maintained throughout
- **Dynamic**: Never hear the same message twice

### For Development:
- **Maintainable**: No hardcoded strings to update
- **Scalable**: Works for any document type/topic
- **Flexible**: Easy to add new context fields
- **Robust**: Handles errors gracefully with fallbacks

## Testing

To test the system:
```bash
# Start JARVIS
./start_jarvis.sh

# Ask JARVIS to write an essay
"Write me a 1000 word essay on climate change"
```

You'll hear JARVIS provide:
- Initial acknowledgment
- Setup progress
- Writing updates
- Section transitions
- Word count milestones
- Completion summary

All narration will be unique, natural, and context-specific!

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Emotional tone variation based on progress
- User preference learning (verbose vs concise)
- Multi-language narration support
- Interruption handling for user questions
- Narration pacing adjustment
