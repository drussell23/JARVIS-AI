## Conclusion

JARVIS's Multi-Agent System architecture provides a solid foundation for autonomous, intelligent assistance. With **53% of agents currently active**, there's significant opportunity to enhance capabilities by activating dormant agents and improving inter-agent communication.

The highest-impact integrations involve connecting the intelligence layer (Goal Inference, Activity Recognition, VSMS Core) with the execution layer (Display Monitor, Control Center Clicker, Autonomous Decision Engine). This will enable true predictive automation and proactive assistance.

**Key Takeaway:** JARVIS has 60+ specialized agents, but only ~30 are fully active. Activating the remaining 30 dormant agents and improving cross-agent integration could **triple** JARVIS's autonomous capabilities.
