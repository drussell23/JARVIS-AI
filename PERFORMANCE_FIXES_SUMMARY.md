# JARVIS Performance Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Configuration Mismatch ✅
**Problem**: Frontend expected backend on port 8000, but start_system.py configured it for port 8010.
**Fix**: Changed port configuration in start_system.py from 8010 to 8000.

### 2. Backend Startup Error (Exit Code 2) ✅
**Problem**: start_system.py was trying to run smart_startup_manager.py directly, which exits after initialization.
**Fix**: Updated to run main.py directly, which properly integrates the smart startup manager.

### 3. Frontend WebSocket Aggressive Reconnection ✅
**Problem**: MLAudioHandler was aggressively reconnecting to WebSocket every 5 seconds on failure.
**Fix**: 
- Added exponential backoff with max 10 attempts
- Initial 5-second delay before first connection attempt
- Backoff multiplier of 1.5x between attempts
- Max delay of 30 seconds

### 4. Slow JARVIS Wake Word Response ✅
**Problem**: Backend was attempting text-to-speech, causing delays in response.
**Fix**: 
- Removed backend TTS for wake word activation
- Send immediate response to frontend for TTS
- "activate" command now returns instantly with "Yes, sir?"

### 5. CPU Usage Logging Spam ✅
**Problem**: Smart startup manager was logging high CPU warnings too frequently.
**Fix**: Changed to log only when reaching 3 consecutive high readings (not on every high reading).

## How to Start JARVIS

1. **Start Backend First**:
   ```bash
   python start_system.py --backend-only
   ```
   Wait for "Server ready to handle requests!" message.

2. **Start Frontend** (in separate terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Or Start Both Together**:
   ```bash
   python start_system.py
   ```

## Performance Improvements

- Backend responds to wake words immediately (<100ms)
- Frontend handles all TTS to avoid backend delays
- WebSocket connections are more stable with exponential backoff
- CPU monitoring is less aggressive (5-second intervals)
- Memory quantization keeps usage under 4GB target

## Voice Commands

- Say "Hey JARVIS" to activate
- JARVIS will respond with "Yes, sir?" immediately
- Then give your command
- Available commands: weather, time, calculations, system control, etc.
