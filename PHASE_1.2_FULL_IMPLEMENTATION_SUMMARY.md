## 🎯 **User Question Answered**

### **Question:**
> "Do I need Apple Watch if I have my laptop to detect that my MacBook is in close distance to the Sony TV?"

### **Answer:**

**YES, you need Apple Watch (or iPhone) ✅**

**Why:**
```
❌ WRONG: "MacBook detects proximity to TV"
   → MacBook Bluetooth = fixed at MacBook location (0m)
   → Can't track movement

✅ CORRECT: "Apple Watch tracks YOUR movement"
   → Watch is on your wrist as you move
   → Bluetooth signal → MacBook calculates your distance
   → JARVIS correlates with TV location
```

**What You Need:**
- ✅ Apple Watch (recommended) **OR**
- ✅ iPhone (in pocket) **OR**
- ✅ AirPods (in ears)

**Any Bluetooth device you carry works!**

✅ Sony TV becomes second screen
✅ You can now drag windows to TV

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPTION B: You Say "No"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[YOU]
"No"

[JARVIS - Internal Processing]
1. Voice command detected: "no"
2. Negative response recognized ✅
3. Register user override (display_id: 23)

✅ JARVIS won't prompt again until cooldown expires

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPTION C: No Response (Timeout)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[30 seconds pass with no response]

[JARVIS - Internal Processing]
1. Prompt timeout (30s elapsed)
2. State updated: TIMEOUT
